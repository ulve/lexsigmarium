## 1.0 CORE CONCEPTS

Battles in Warhammer Age of Sigmar are fought on a surface that is referred to as the battlefield. Each battle uses a scenario called a **battleplan**, which will explain how to set up the **battlefield** and how to determine the winner.

Each player is the **commander** of an **army**. Each army belongs to a **faction** and is made up of groups of models called units. Models and units in your army are referred to as **friendly** models and units, and models and units in your opponent’s army are referred to as **enemy** models and units.

## 2.0 TOOLS OF WAR

To fight a battle, you will need:

* A tape measure 
* Some dice
* A surface to play on (the battlefield) 
* 2 armies of Citadel Miniatures

### 2.1 MEASURING DISTANCES

Distances in Warhammer Age of Sigmar are measured in **inches** ("), between the closest points on the bases of the models you're measuring to and from. You can measure distances whenever you wish. When measuring the distance between units, always measure the distance between the closest points on the bases of the closest models in each unit. If a model does not have a base, measure to and from the closest point on the model instead.

#### 2.1.1 WITHIN AND WHOLLY WITHIN

A **model** is **within** a certain distance of something (e.g. another unit, a territory or an objective) if any part of its base is within that distance. A **model** is **wholly within** a certain distance of something if every part of its base is within that distance.

A **unit** is **within** a certain distance of something if any part of the base of any model in the unit is within that distance. A **unit** is **wholly within** a certain distance of something if every part of the bases of all of the models in the unit is within that distance.

### 2.2 DICE

Warhammer Age of Sigmar uses six-sided dice, often abbreviated to **D6**.

* Some rules refer to ‘2D6’, ‘3D6’ and so on – in such cases, roll a number of dice equal to the number before ‘D6’ and add the results together.
* A roll of ‘2+’ means a roll of 2 or more, a roll of ‘3+’ means a roll of 3 or more, and so on.
* If a rule requires you to roll a D3, roll a dice and halve the total, rounding up. For **D3** rolls, a roll of ‘2+’ means a result of 2 or more after halving the total and rounding up.
* Effects that allow you to modify a dice roll are called **modifiers**.
* Some rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll, which means you get to roll some or all of the dice again. You cannot re-roll a dice more than once, and re-rolls happen before modifiers to the roll (if any) are applied.
* If you are instructed to roll off, each player should roll a dice. Whichever player has a higher roll wins the roll-off. If the result is a tie, each player should roll off again until there is a clear winner, unless otherwise specified.
## 3.0 FACTIONS

Each army belongs to a **faction**, e.g. Stormcast Eternals or Skaven.  
Each faction has a set of **faction rules**, which include **battle traits**,  
**battle formations**, **enhancements** and **lores**. These can be found in various publications but most commonly in the faction’s **battletome**.

## 4.0 WARSCROLLS

The rules for each unit are contained on a warscroll:

1. The **MOVE** characteristic determines how quickly the uni6t c"an move across the battlefield (see 15.0).
2. The **HEALTH** characteristic determines how many damage points can be allocated to a unit before a model in the unit is slain (see 18.2).
3. The **CONTROL** characteristic determines how well each model in the unit can contest objectives (see 32.2).
4. The **SAVE** characteristic determines how well armoured the unit is. This characteristic is the roll you need to equal or exceed to save a model from harm, so a lower value is better (see 17.0).
5. The **UNIT TYPE**.
6. The **KEYWORDS** that the unit has (see 5.1)
7. The **WEAPONS** the unit is armed with. Weapons are either **melee weapons**, used to make **combat attacks**, or **ranged weapons**, used to make shooting attacks. Each weapon has its own characteristics (see 16.0).
8. Any special **ABILITIES** the unit can use (see 5.0).
