## Battle Traits

### Masters of Destiny

<WarscrollAbility ability={{"name":"Masters of Destiny","header":{"icon":"special","color":"black","text":"Deployment Phase"},"effect":"Roll 9 dice and place them to one side. These are your **destiny dice**.  **Destiny dice** can be spent during the battle to change certain dice rolls. You can never have more than 9 **destiny dice** at once.\n\n During the battle, instead of making a roll from the list below for a friendly **DISCIPLES OF TEENTCH** unit, you can spend your **destiny dice**. The roll you would have made is replaced with the roll on the **destiny dice** you spend. If you want to replace a 2D6 roll, 3D6 roll, etc. you must spend a number of **destiny dice** equal to the number before 'D6.  Any rolls that have been replaced count as unmodified rolls, and they cannot be re-rolled, they cannot be changed and they cannot be modified by other friendly abilities (but they can be modified by enemy abilities). You cannot spend **destiny dice** to replace re-rolls.\n\n **Destiny dice** can be spent in place of the following dice rolls:\n\n * Casting rolls\n * Unbinding rolls\n * Banishment rolls\n * Run rolls\n * Charge rolls in your turn\n * Hit rolls\n * Wound rolls\n * Save rolls\n"}} />
