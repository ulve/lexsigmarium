## Battle Traits

### An Excess of Depravity

<WarscrollAbility ability={{"name":"An Excess of Depravity","header":{"icon":"special","color":"black","text":"Once Per Battle Round (Army), Start of Battle Round"},"declare":"Pick up to 3 friendly **HEDONITES OF SLAANESH** units to be the targets.","effect":"The targets have the **EUPHORIC** keyword for the rest of the battle round.\n\nIn addition, for each friendly unit you pick, give your opponent 1 **temptation dice**. Your opponent can use 1 **temptation dice** to replace 1 wound roll, 1 save roll, 1 ward roll or 1 **run** roll for a unit in their army with a 6, or they can use 2 **temptation dice** to replace 2 of the dice in a **charge** roll for a unit in their army with two 6s.\n\nEach time your opponent uses a **temptation dice**, they must roll it. On a 1-2, your opponent’s roll is replaced by that value instead of a 6, and you must allocate D3 damage points to the unit for which the roll was replaced immediately after the ability used by that unit has been resolved (ward rolls cannot be made for those damage points).\n\nAt the end of the battle round, any **temptation dice** that have not been used are lost."}} />
