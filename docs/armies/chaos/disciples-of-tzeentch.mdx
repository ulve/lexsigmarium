### Masters of Destiny

<WarscrollAbility ability={{"name":"Masters of Destiny","header":{"icon":"special","color":"black","text":"Deployment Phase"},"effect":"Roll 9 dice and place them to one side. These are your **destiny dice**. **Destiny dice** can be spent during the battle to change certain dice rolls. You can never have more than 9 **destiny dice** at once.\n\nDuring the battle, instead of making a roll from the list below for a friendly **DISCIPLES OF TZEENTCH** unit, you can spend your **destiny dice**. The roll you would have made is replaced with the roll on the **destiny dice** you spend. If you want to replace a 2D6 roll, 3D6 roll, etc. you must spend a number of **destiny dice** equal to the number before ‘D6’. Any rolls that have been replaced count as unmodified rolls, and they cannot be re-rolled, they cannot be changed and they cannot be modified by other friendly abilities except for those that apply negative modifiers. (but they can be modified by enemy abilities). You cannot spend **destiny** **dice** to replace re-rolls.\n\n**Destiny dice** can be spent in place of the following dice rolls:\n• Casting rolls\n• Unbinding rolls\n• Banishment rolls\n• **Run** rolls\n• **Charge** rolls in your turn\n• Hit rolls\n• Wound rolls\n• Save rolls"}} />

Once a destiny dice has been used, it is discarded.\n\nIf you want to replace a roll that uses more than one D6, you must use the same number of **destiny dice** (e.g. you would need to use 2 **destiny dice** in place of a 2D6 casting roll). Rolls that are replaced count as unmodified rolls and cannot be re-rolled or modified unless noted.\n\nThe following rolls can be replaced with **destiny dice**:\n\n• Casting rolls\n• **Run** rolls\n• **Charge** rolls\n• Hit rolls\n• Wound rolls\n• Save rolls – you must still modify the roll by the Rend characteristic of the attacking weapon."}} />
