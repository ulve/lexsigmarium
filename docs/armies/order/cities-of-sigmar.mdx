The card stays separate until you use the command on it or score the battle tactic on it as described below.","effect":"When you use the command on that card, it is not discarded but returns to your hand. Your opponent can check the information on it before it returns to your hand. The card goes back to being a normal battle tactic card, with the exception that you cannot use the command on it in the same phase it went back into your hand.\n\nIf you did not use the command on the card you separated, you can still score the battle tactic on it at the end of your turn as normal if you met its conditions. If you do so, discard it as normal. If you neither used the command nor scored the battle tactic on the card, it automatically returns to your hand at the end of your turn.\n\n**Designer’s Note:** *This ability essentially lets you use a command ‘for free’, but you have to choose the command at the start of the battle round, so it requires some planning ahead!*"}} />
