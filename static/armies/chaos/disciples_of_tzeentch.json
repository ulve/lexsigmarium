      "lore": "Anyone who walks the Path to Glory risks becoming a grotesque Chaos Spawn. Distorted by a critical mass of mutative ‘gifts’, hardly anything of their former self is recognisable – perhaps only the twisted vestiges of what was once their face, mouth distended in a permanent scream of horror. In some cases, only the mind remains terribly aware, trapped in its prison of roiling flesh.\n\nSpawn are possessed of a monstrous strength, able to rip flesh and tear limbs from bodies with each of their multi-jointed appendages or grasping pseudopods. They fight erratically, as likely to slither and slump as to thrash and maim. Whichever instinct seizes them, they cause bloody carnage with no thought for their own self-preservation – almost as if they wish to be put out of their misery.\n\nArcanites often keep packs of gibbering Spawn within their hidden sanctums, ready to unleash against any who trespass in the cult’s abode. These abominations were created through Tzeentch’s fell blessings, and his magic now sustains them. They instinctively flock to the most gifted sorcerers, bathing in the esoteric energies conjured by their spellcraft and forming a wall of thrashing flesh to bar any who would harm the Great Conspirator’s chosen.",

They do not simply burn out once sated; shapes and figures seem to flicker in their depths, and it is far from unknown for them to seemingly extinguish before suddenly bursting into being once more. This often comes as a terminal shock to enemies who had believed that they had passed through the inferno intact, only to be suddenly overcome and burnt to death by fire-spirits that were waiting for the moment they deemed most cruelly entertaining. Other fire-conjuring daemons are inexorably drawn to Exalted Flamers, revelling in the grand blazes that these aberrations can unleash. Arcane blazes rage far more intensely in their presence, seeming only to grow in strength the more desperately a foe tries to smother them.",

Rather than being honed through honest toil, this power is only borrowed, temporarily conjured through enchantments. The Acolytes find no shame in this. With a mere incantation, they can briefly acquire a physique that a warrior might take decades to achieve – what better way to prove the superiority of magic?\n\nFreed to unleash their potential, Kairic Acolytes seize the opportunity by conjuring torrents of pink and blue bolts to bombard their foes. Avian helms hide their features, whilst ornate blades and flame-shaped shields are wielded in close quarters. Some carry scraps of arcane lore or avian Vulcharc familiars, the better to aid the cultists as they perform dark rituals around sites of power, channelling natural magic into Chaotic energy. Yet though every Acolyte may believe themselves favoured, they are ultimately pawns, each to be expended as their masters see fit.",

They manifest as a shimmering wheel of fire that distends into the avian heads of the greater daemon, its beaks dripping with the liquid stuff of Chaos and change.\n\nWithin each Daemonic Simulacrum lingers the hunger of its infernal counterpart – a hunger for souls, minds and, above all, the power of the arcane. As these spell-constructs cross the battlefield, their jaws snap at any prey in range, tearing out portions of their essence and channelling it back into Tzeentch’s domain. The scent of a wizard’s soul is most pleasing of all, driving the Simulacrum to new extremes of snapping ferocity.\n\nArcanite sorcerers will offer much of their souls for the ability to invoke a Daemonic Simulacrum. Few realise that the greater daemons peer through the eyes of a Simulacrum, observing events in the Mortal Realms from a calculated distance and delighting in how their puppets dance.",

Souls are their favoured delicacy, but aetheric energies are similarly ripe for consumption. Mortal flesh makes for a fine meal, too – though the act of ripping open prey with their circular, shredding maws sustains the Screamers far more than any physical nourishment.\n\nChampions of Tzeentch have long used Screamers as aerial shock cavalry. They are single-minded in hunting for their next mouthful of magic; Screamer shoals have been known to chase endless spells across entire landmasses. Sharpened spines and ridges jut out from the Screamers’ sleek forms, and the speeds they can reach make them deadly living missiles. Screamer shoals dart through an enemy formation without pause, scything down foes without breaking pace. Even monsters must be wary of these daemons; there are tales of Mega-Gargants that thought to pluck one of these strange beasts out of the sky for a quick snack, only to be whittled down to the bone by a sudden hurricane of fangs.",

Even hardened warriors cannot help but flinch as their most buried insecurities are suddenly laid bare – giving the Enlightened ample opportunity to run them through.\n\nThe Enlightened often serve as bodyguards and shock troops for Arcanite cult leaders, permitted to seize their choice of magical plunder in exchange for their dubious loyalties. They are valued not only for their physical brawn but also for their propensity for unveiling the secrets of fellow Arcanites. Of course, there is no guarantee that the Enlightened are not themselves lying. For these Tzaangors, the ambitions of fellow Tzeentch worshippers are things to examine and exploit, much like the secrets of their adversaries. To prey upon the weaknesses of others fills them with a malicious glee most pleasing to the Change God.",

Yet with unsettling inevitably, their targets find themselves in the projectile’s path, losing their footing or becoming distracted at a critical moment. All this has been foreseen by the Skyfire; they have accounted for as many possible futures as their fractured mind can handle, removing impediments to their arrows striking.\n\nSkyfires excel as assassins, pursuing those who would hinder Tzeentch’s designs. The Discs of Tzeentch they ride upon help them to keep pace with their prey. Attempting to wield a bow while riding one of these swift daemon-forms would normally be a futile endeavour, but the Skyfires’ foresight allows them to maintain a degree of accuracy and keep one step ahead of those marked for death.",

Blades, bullets and even retaliatory spells sputter to nothing against a Lord of Change’s wards, even as the daemon unleashes kaleidoscopic storms of witchfire in turn.\n\nA Lord of Change satisfies its well of curiosity by ensnaring mortals in complex schemes, raising favoured acolytes up to the dizzying heights of their ambitions before casting them down. These daemons care not for the consequences facing those they torment; instead, they watch their suffering with enraptured fascination. Yet Lords of Change are manipulative to the point of compulsiveness, always adding new dimensions to their schemes even if it compromises their original aims. Many times has one of the Change God’s grand ploys unravelled because his Lords of Change could not stop plucking the skeins of fate – though even this anarchy is pleasing to Tzeentch.",

Other daemons must simply trust that these entities’ fiery urges will serve Tzeentch’s schemes in time. Even so, there are occasions in which an Exalted Flamer must be conveyed to a specific point or have its already destructive capabilities heightened. In these instances, a chariot will be prepared, formed of sorcery and bound daemons. In the wake of a Burning Chariot follows the very fires of change – fires that are stoked by the presence of the Exalted Flamer. While typically content to kill at range, Exalted Flamers also take a giddy glee in directing their carriage into a dive, swooping across enemy formations and leaving behind a wreckage of charred, twisted flesh.",

Before long, the afflicted rise as glistening Tzaangors, ready to join the Shaman’s ranks.\n\nTzaangor believe that, by imbibing potions of distilled mage-blood, their Shamans enter a trance that allows them to spirit-walk into the Realm of Chaos and receive commands from the Lords of Change. Some Shamans are ordered to lend guidance to an Arcanite cult, whilst others remain with their warflocks. These mutant sorcerers guide their kin in all manner of rituals, lead hunts for arcane treasures or oversee the rising of flux-cairns that distort magic into forms more pleasing to the Changer of the Ways.",

Legs transform into gangly, boneless arms and bodies turn inside-out, organs pulsating ghoulishly in the wind. So potent is the aura of change that these Sigils exude that magic itself goes awry in their proximity, devolving into a primordial sludge for the Disciples of Tzeentch to better craft with.\n\nWithin the hidden sanctums of the Arcanite cults, lesser Burning Sigils are used as a form of defence. Only those with Tzeentch’s fickle favour can endure their mutating presence; outsiders are liable to be reduced to gibbering lumps of flesh before they can speak of what they have discovered. In battle, Burning Sigils are often conjured atop nexuses of geomantic power, inundating these natural magical nodes with Tzeentch’s touch. Those who would claim the nearby lands must brave the Sigil’s presence and attempt to banish it – before their own flesh betrays them and comes undone.",

Yet these tangible boons are secondary to the creatures’ strangest ability: through mere proximity, they can glean echoes of past events, hidden truths and suppressed secrets. Even hardened warriors cannot help but flinch as their most buried insecurities are suddenly laid bare – giving the Enlightened ample opportunity to run them through.\n\nThe most favoured Enlightened are granted daemonic conveyances known as Discs of Tzeentch to carry them into battle. They flock around the Shamans of their kind, forming a screeching honour guard. When their arcane master demands that some critical nexus of magic be seized, it is their Enlightened who see it done. Approaching the target at terrible speed, they shriek out the secrets of entrenched enemies, cackling in delight as confusion and horror reigns. It is then that the Enlightened dive into the melee, letting their spears and the spinning blades of their Discs facilitate the crude but satisfying business of slaughter.",

Even briefly consulting the Tome unlocks new paradigms of arcane practice, with spells once far beyond the caster’s ability becoming simple. New runes of insight appear even as the reader’s eyes reach them. None can say who composes these scribblings – perhaps one of the daemon scribes of Tzeentch’s court or even a fragmented aspect of the god himself.\n\nYet no gift of Chaos is given freely. The runes within the Tome of Eyes are elements of a terrible hex, one that takes full form as a reader plunges recklessly through its pages. The end result of the Parchment Curse is always the same: the victim transforms into scattered sheaves of paper, each detailing a twisted version of their life story. A talented mage may be able to transfer the accumulating energies of the curse from their mind into an unwilling target. Yet eventually the hunger for knowledge resurfaces, and the Tome awaits…",

Amongst its greatest coups was thieving seven of Nurgle’s sacred tomes from their place beside the Plague God’s cauldron, bringing Tzeentch many of his rival’s secrets. Arguably the Changeling’s grandest deception, though, was creating the persona of Valius Maliti, the master architect who designed many of the first Cities of Sigmar. In these bastions of Order, therefore, lie subtle flaws, ready for exploitation by Tzeentch’s legions.\n\nThe Changeling considers engaging in battle to be a personal failure, for spreading discord from the shadows is far more satisfying. Even so, there is a certain thrill to be found in impersonating officers and trusted companions, misinterpreting or mislaying orders so that an enemy force finds itself suddenly vulnerable amidst the carnage of war. Should the Changeling’s disguise somehow be seen through, this is no great concern to the daemon; the eldritch fires it summons and the form-shifting powers of its Trickster’s Staff can overcome most potential impediments.",

Though they prefer to operate from their sorcerous lairs, when Magisters take to the field, they revel in unleashing their most devastating evocations. With a gesture, these master sorcerers summon roaring flames of every colour or exude rays of pure change-magic that warp enemies beyond recognition. The more outlandish the fate they can inflict, the more honour they do to the Changer of the Ways.\n\nMagisters who take a particular delight in the carnage of open magical warfare will seek out a Screamer to act as their mount, warping the daemonic creature’s flesh and alloying it with strange metals until it serves as a Disc of Tzeentch. Having eschewed the subtlety typical to their kind, they have embraced their role as the bringers of violent change. Contrails of flame billow in their wake as they blaze through the skies alongside other airborne minions. The Magisters hungrily draw upon these fires to wield as tools of annihilation, scouring the lands until they are more pleasing to Tzeentch’s ninefold gaze.",

It was through the towering obelisk of jade at Nephricar’s heart that the Speaker in the Stone first entreated the people of Vexothskol. It seduced Mason-King Mephrobaal and his subjects with promises of power, inflicting the stone-flesh curse upon them in exchange for bolstering their physical might.\n\nThe Jade Obelisk travel the realms in search of idols to demolish. The most honoured carry shards of the great pinnacle of Nephricar, capable of transmuting the flesh of their enemies to stone.

They are drawn to the arcane, seeking to amass it wherever it is found – whether a thaumaturgical relic or a confluence of ley lines, the Tzaangors covet it all the same.\n\nTzaangors carry a variety of ornate blades crafted by their cultist allies, which they wield with surprising skill. They supplement these with vicious natural weapons, such as stabbing beaks that can pierce a human’s skull. Many Tzaangors also possess limited prophetic abilities; though this foreknowledge renders their movements twitchy and unnatural, they take great pride in what they see as a boon of their patron, and they jealously hoard any gleaned secrets.",

Horrors find cruel mirth in wielding these arcane projectiles against Tzeentch’s enemies, observing the unpredictable results with fascination.\n\nThough they are nonsensical beings, there is a crazed logic to the hierarchy of the Horrors. The largest are the Pink Horrors, the most jovial and arcanely talented of their infernal breed. Should a Pink Horror receive a telling wound, they will gasp dramatically before coming apart in a burst of ectoplasm. In its place are two smaller daemons known as Blue Horrors. These are more bitter and sullen but can unleash barrages of magic regardless. When a Blue Horror is slain, blazing imps known as Brimstone Horrors spring up. These diminutive daemons are the most vindictive breed of Horror. Lacking in higher thought and prone to burning themselves out rapidly, they swarm towards enemies with cackles of malice, intent on setting alight cloth and flesh.",

With a gesture, these master sorcerers summon roaring flames of every colour or exude rays of pure changemagic that warp enemies beyond recognition. The more outlandish the fate they can inflict, the more honour they do to the Changer of the Ways.\n\nMagisters are privy to eldritch secrets that have twisted them into something unnatural. Their limbs grow long and backwards-jointed, while their faces mutate into leering masks or sprout with clusters of iridescent eyes. Yet for all their arcane might, Magisters are still mortals, and they risk body and soul each time they channel the unbound potential of change. Many are the tales of Magisters who drank from the font of their god’s power too eagerly and found themselves eventually overwhelmed by it, reduced to a mewling lump of flesh. But Tzeentch demands unlimited ambition from his Magisters, and the lure of ultimate sorcerous might is a prize they will go to any length to claim.",

Enraged, the survivors fell into the embrace of Chaos, selling their souls for vengeance.\n\nThaumaturges are the inheritors of the ogroids’ more esoteric traditions, and in their pursuit of magical lore, they have embraced service to Tzeentch. Though brutish, horned and bestial creatures, they are undeniably beings of the arcane, their flesh constantly writhing with eldritch energies. A Thaumaturge’s sorcerous ability is channelled through the head of their totemic staff – a tool hand-crafted by the ogroid themselves – and released in storms of multi-hued wyrdflame.\n\nThaumaturges are certainly cunning, as many Magisters who seek to manipulate them learn to their cost, but their battle-rage is never far from the surface. When pain strikes, Thaumaturges fly into a frenzy, discarding the subtle arts of magic in their need to crush and tear. Such brute strength is of great value to the Arcanite cults, who flatter the ogroids into spearheading their most aggressive uprisings.",

      "lore": "Aeons ago, Tzeentch hurled the Lord of Change known as Kairos into the Well of Eternity, curious as to what would become of the daemon within that abyss of infinite possibility. The being that emerged from that roiling maelstrom was fundamentally altered from that which had come before. Kairos’s essence had bifurcated, two heads sprouting from his wizened shoulders. The right head could see the many forks of the future, while the left possessed perfect clarity on all that had transpired in the past. Yet in becoming attuned to the flow of eternity, Kairos sundered himself from the present; unable to follow time as it passes, he now can only see what was and what might be.\n\nThe secrets Kairos is privy to have made him the Architect of Fate’s foremost lieutenant, sent into the Mortal Realms to oversee the most vital manipulations of destiny. Though his inability to perceive the present may occasionally blindside him, Fateweaver allows only those who serve his purpose to draw close. Those he deems irrelevant are disposed of with bolts of pure mutation or torrents of prismatic wyrdflame, both of Kairos’s heads cackling in cruel mirth as they watch the prelude to and consequences of this destructive spellcraft unfold.",
