Master Moulders are experts in stitching muscle and flesh into new forms, and they use warpstone to trigger mutations that twist a mortal corpus beyond recognition. Master Moulders take a warped pride in the monsters they have brought into unholy life and consider the battlefield successes of these creatures to be firmly their own.",
