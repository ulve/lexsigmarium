      "lore": "Deep within the phantasmagorical nightmare-scapes of the Realm of Chaos lies the Forge of Souls. It is a domain of clanking cogs and blazing essence-forges in which the arms and armaments of the greatest champions of Chaos are crafted. Sometimes, when a daemon is banished in an especially humiliating fashion, their bitterness will lead them to seek the insane overseers of the Forge. To these seekers is offered a bargain: an opportunity to re-enter the Mortal Realms far sooner than the terms of banishment typically allows in exchange for paying a tithe of souls to the forgemasters. Daemons who accept these stipulations are transformed; their essence is sealed into frames of hellforged, piston-driven iron, while their limbs sprout blazing cannons and other infernal weaponry. They become Soul Grinders, fusions of metal and raw Chaotic energy, unleashed upon the hapless realms.\n\nSoul Grinders are formidable engines of destruction, capable of scything down ranks of lesser troops either from afar or in the midst of a melee. Ultimately, however, they are doomed to an eternity of servitude. The masters of the Forge are forever shifting their quotas and recalculating the souls that must be claimed, ensuring that those who have become their immortal instruments can never escape the pact they so foolishly made.",

There is truth to this, for Fomoroids are living weapons of annihilation, though their nature is more faceted than appearances suggest. Once, they were builders, not breakers; their affinity for stonecraft saw them raise wondrous edifices, serving as a mason caste for one of the great civilisations of the Allpoints. The Fomoroids had only just won their freedom in a great rebellion when Archaon invaded the island between-realms, binding the creatures into his service through the use of sorcerous runes carved into their flesh.\n\nFomoroids are a common sight in the fighting pits of the Varanspire, where the bone-crushing acts of violence they wreak are met with approving roars from the crowd. Few see inside the cages and lairs of the Fomoroids, where gristle and broken bones are formed into something approaching crude statuary. Yet these flickers of creativity within the Fomoroids are quickly suppressed by the runes that bind them, drowning out any higher ambition with the lust to destroy.",

Rings of flame-licked spikes protrude from the ground around such a location, carved with runes in the dark tongue. Above the nexus point hangs a prism of enchanted stone – within languish daemonic entities that feed upon magical power drawn from the earth, pumping ruinous energies back into the negative space their hunger has created within the ley lines.\n\nThe creation of a Nexus Chaotica is always a calculated risk. For the corrupting effects of the shrine to take hold, its captive daemons must absorb the energies of the realms. As they do so, their desperation to escape sees their prison begin to splinter, pulsing with unpredictable energy. Yet the ability of a Nexus Chaotica to corrupt a wide swathe of land in short order cannot be underestimated. Such are the deeds upon which dark legends are established – and the champions of Chaos are nothing if not hungry for renown.",

Even should they succeed in these martial trials, the Chieftain must hone their tactical cunning, wielding their tribal kin as a weapon with which to complete even bolder oaths. The gods do not look kindly upon those who rest on their laurels, and the Chieftains are expected to win ever greater glories – or face the consequences.\n\nDarkoath Chieftains know that reputation is a powerful weapon. By gaining glory through bloodshed, they are able to bind even greater throngs of tribal warriors to their side – warriors who will fight and die without fear to share in their champion’s victories. The best way to accrue notoriety is to fell the greatest warriors one can find. Chieftains carve their oathstones with vows of profound ambition, promising to offer the strongest of souls to their gods in exchange for the will and power to rise above the masses.",

Even the riders of the rival Takblood tribe concede that none are as capable of teasing out speed from a warhorse, nor as skilled in loosing pinpoint arrows while galloping at full tilt, as Singri.\n\nSingri charges into battle with a brash ferocity, one that often vexes her father. Yet though the pair argue frequently, a deep affection runs between them; they are all the family they have, since Singri’s mother was killed by Azyrites and her uncle Jorvik fell to the temptations of Chaos. No matter how far she rides, Singri always keeps an eye upon her father, and Gunnar has been saved more than once by her keen-eyed arrow fire.",

It takes the huge and heavily muscled destriers known as Chaos Steeds to grant the thing motion; these beasts are mutants themselves, often sporting dripping fangs or snorting flame from their nostrils. Though a Chaos Chariot is slow to accelerate, once it has begun to build pace, there is little that can stop it, and the driver’s cruel whip ensures that the Chaos Steeds maintain their speed. The charge of an entire squadron of chariots is like an avalanche of scythed metal, caving in shieldwalls and crushing the will to fight of entire armies.",

Some sprout flailing tentacles or trilling animalistic heads. They may slither or lope or skitter on needle-legs. Many bear traces of their former face somewhere on their warped frame, locked in a silent scream. All Chaos Spawn, however, possess brutal strength and a maniacal disregard for self-preservation. It is not known whether this is because they are truly mindless or because some part of them longs to end their suffering through combat.\n\nChaos Spawn often remain in the orbit of their former tribe. Some are treated as contemptible warbeasts, while others lurk in caves near their people’s camp and subsist on sacrifices of living flesh. Either way, they are tangible proof for any young warrior of what awaits those who falter on the Path. Though they have long since lost any hope of attaining glory, Chaos Spawn retain a sense for godly favour. They follow the wake of those most blessed by the Powers, desperate for an echo of the glory that was once theirs.",

Yet unlike the greenskins and ogors, the Goroans valued civilisation; they studied metallurgy and masonry, developed crude philosophy and raised a proud city known as High Progrexia. When orruks ransacked their home, the Goroans were overcome with rage, fighting a doomed war against the clans of the wild. It was Archaon who promised the Goroans vengeance if they would serve. They became shock troops in his armies and marshals of his warpits, no longer able to deny the bestial rage within them. It was this animal fury that drew comparisons with ogorkind and saw the term ‘ogroid’ rise to prominence.\n\nMyrmidons are amongst the most formidable ogroids, the most skilled champions of their arenas. Having retained their people’s stubborn pride, they now strive to test themselves against opponents of an especially monstrous heft. With their honed skills, innate battle rage and ancestral weapons, the Myrmidons are far from outclassed in these titanic clashes. Should they truly be pushed, the runic tattoos inked across their flesh will ignite with power – driving a Myrmidon to even greater pitches of fury.",

Yet, as with all things born of Chaos, these boons balance forever on a knife edge. A Daemonrift is fed through magic, and as spells are cast in its proximity, its power seems only to grow. Should it expand too far, the daemon may be able to force entry into the realms – and will quickly take revenge on the sorcerer who sought to deny it.\n\nA Daemonrift is not only a tool of war but also a means of communicating with the scions of the gods themselves. Some nomadic cults and tribes have taken to following errant Daemonrifts as they spread their fractures across the realms, divining portentous meaning in the devastation they wreak.",

She is a warrior of matchless willpower, convinced that there is no challenge she cannot best through bloody-minded grit. To Abraxia, Chaos represents a state of perpetual testing rather than being embodied in four insane gods. Such an anti-deific attitude pleases Archaon, who offers Abraxia that rarest of boons – a measure of his trust. In her conquest of the Sigmarite city of the Phoenicium, Abraxia consumed the sacred fire at the bastion’s heart. Cinder now flickers when she speaks, while in her eyes rages a tortured and captive flame.\n\nAbraxia rides to war atop a reptilian beast known as the Thanatorg. This ferocious creature once lurked in the depths of the Eightpoints, and its blood is highly corrosive. Her symbol of office, however, is undeniably the spear known as Gorbolga the Accurs’d. Wrought from Varanite, Gorbolga can induce rampant, flesh-twisting mutation in those nearby, much to Abraxia’s dark amusement. Yet it requires an unbending conviction to control the spear – and even the slightest lapse can see it rebel, as the Grand Marshal’s twin horns ably testify.",

Though they despise the Everchosen, the Gaunt Summoners have since proven an invaluable cabal of advisors, seers and agents.\n\nWith a flick of their multi-jointed limbs, a Gaunt Summoner can conjure gouts of wyrdflame to engulf a formation – fires that do not burn but instead induce unpredictable mutations, perhaps turning flesh to glass or ribs to flailing tentacles. Far more intriguing to a Gaunt Summoner, however, is to trap an adversary within a Silver Tower.

Through baleful invocation, the Shrinemaster can harness these energies to perform sinister miracles across the battlefield.\n\nIn the presence of a Warshrine, the faithful of the Dark Gods are preserved against even the most determined strikes. Those who pledge their souls more completely to a single deity display more profound blessings still; they may be granted deeper fury, greater swiftness, armour that roils and absorbs the blows of the enemy without damage, and more besides. Those who lack such favour are compelled to seek glory all the more intently, for the gaze of the gods is drawn to a Warshrine, and in the presence of such a construct are the greatest opportunities for renown afforded.",

Upon their coming of age, they take part in ‘blooding raids’ on enemy territory, usually targeting rival clans or Sigmarites. During this trial they will swear their first oath, offering their own blood to an oathstone and promising a gift of sacrifice to their tribal gods. Darkoath do not rely upon close formations and well-drilled tactics in the manner of a more conventional army. Their greatest strengths are their intimate connection with the Chaos wilds and their ability to sense where the enemy is weakest and strike decisively. Lent strength by their oaths, the Marauders crash into the fray without pity or remorse, determined to earn glory through slaughter.",

Even should they succeed in these martial trials, the Chieftain must hone their tactical cunning, wielding their tribal kin as a weapon with which to complete even bolder oaths. The gods do not look kindly on those who rest on their laurels, and the Chieftains are expected to win ever greater glories – or face the consequences.\n\nDarkoath Chieftains lead from the front, demonstrating their right to rule by ploughing headlong into enemies and setting about with hewing strokes from axe or blade. Their favoured steeds are the hulking warhorses that can survive in the wastes of the realms, which the Darkoath clad in bladed masks and hang with the remains of especially powerful foes. The presence of a Chieftain can lend the charge of Darkoath cavalry even greater impetus, for the eye of the gods falls upon these figures, and as a result, there are plenty of opportunities to catch divine attention.",

Slaughterbrutes roam where the greatest massacres have occurred or else amongst the most inhospitable mountain passes. It is to here that a champion of Chaos must travel if they wish to bind such a creature to their will – but such is a Slaughterbrute’s choler that it will fight to the death before accepting even the most determined master. Other means must be used to secure their bestial allegiance.\n\nA champion looking to claim a Slaughterbrute as a prize will bid their sorcerers or god-speakers craft blades inscribed with runes of command. Once such a weapon has been driven into a Slaughterbrute’s back – a task easier said than done, given the creature’s many limbs and boundless frenzy – it can be controlled by the champion who embedded the blade. Yet should it come loose, or should the Slaughterbrute’s master die, then the beast will soon take its vengeance on all who sought to collar it.",

Fellriders, as these tribal horsemasters are known, are daring even by the standards of the Oathsworn clans. Whooping in glee and swinging their weapons in bloodthirsty arcs, they are the vanguard of the tribe’s forces, swearing to their gods that they will be the first to take heads and claim glory.\n\nThe steeds of the Fellriders are not the half-daemonic beasts mastered by Chaos Knights, but they are still far more fearsome than any mere warhorse. Daubed with tribal war paint and sporting grotesque daemonic masks affixed to their muzzles, these steeds are nevertheless treated with a measure of honour by the Darkoath. That said, a great many are fed with scraps of human flesh, developing a taste for it until the smells of battle drive them to trample and maim almost as readily as their riders.",

As the pack swarms over their monstrous quarry, their razor-sharp beaks and bladed hind limbs will target the eyes and patches of more vulnerable flesh with a keen focus, soon leaving them bleeding and weakened. The piercing screeches of massed Raptoryx are, if anything, even more debilitating; even a gargant can be left reeling under this sonic assault, ready to be overcome by the screaming creatures.\n\nThe first Raptoryx came into being when the Everchosen’s hordes flooded into the Allpoints, blasting the interstitial island-between-realms with mutative energies. Caught amidst this warping storm, the native creatures of the Allpoints were blended and twisted into new and horrific forms. Though the Raptoryx are indigenous to what is now the Eightpoints, their flocks have since spread across the realms, either passing through realmgates or being coaxed and corralled into the warbands of Chaos champions through the promise of fresh meat.",

Even as they galloped along the Path to Glory, they retained the traditions of mounted combat, though any notion of knightly chivalry was soon stripped away. Others received their monstrous destriers as a gift from the gods, a reward for some worthy desecration or massacre. Whatever their origins, Chaos Knights delight in nothing more than overrunning a foe’s presumed places of safety, crushing sacred lands into smouldering rubble beneath their trampling charge.",

They are masters of the Silver Towers, esoteric fortresses that drift beyond time and space and are filled to the brim with gibbering daemons. The Gaunt Summoners were once free to pursue their agendas how they saw fit, but Archaon the Everchosen coveted their service. Through great cunning, he managed to acquire the true names of each and, thus, was able to bind them to his will. Though they despise the Everchosen, the Gaunt Summoners have since proven an invaluable cabal of advisors, seers and agents.\n\nGaunt Summoners are immensely proud beings who consider walking the crudely mundane earth of the realms to be an indignity. Often, they will summon a Disc of Tzeentch to serve as their mount – a fellow daemon they have bound and shaped through magic into a floating, bladed conveyance. Stood atop a Disc, the Gaunt Summoner hurtles across the battlefield, attending to critical elements of their schemes in person. When needs must, they summon torrents of mutative wyrdflame to overcome the foe or open portals to their Silver Towers in which to trap especially intriguing adversaries.",

The most egotistical and war-hungry, however, revel in the adulation of their mortal lessers – for they are as living gods to the hordes of ruin, proof that ascension is possible to achieve.

Were Archaon’s ultimate goals to be realised, it would be his banners alone rising over the charred corpse of the realms.\n\nArchaon’s mastery as a warrior and general has been honed through truly apocalyptic warfare. Alongside these natural gifts, he wields the Seven Treasures of the Everchosen, the relics he claimed to earn his title. The soul-devouring Slayer of Kings, the unyielding Armour of Morkar and the future-scrying Eye of Sheerian are amongst the most favoured of these dread artefacts. Most infamous is Dorghar, Steed of the Apocalypse – a winged, chimerical titan that bears Archaon to war. Dorghar’s three heads each evoke a greater daemon once sent to test the Everchosen and that was subsequently devoured. Its Khornate head draws sustenance from consuming the strongest foes, its Tzeentchian head has the ability to devour magic, and its Nurglite head can spew torrents of highly corrosive vomit that reduce clusters of warriors to steaming puddles of gore.",

The Goroans, as they know themselves, once fought in the armies of primal Gorkamorka. Unlike their orruk and ogor kin, however, the Goroans saw notions of trade, forgecraft and magical study as worthy goals and sought to craft an advanced civilisation. Alas, the Twin-Headed God’s more basal hordes took umbrage with this. They sacked the Goroan capital of High Progrexia and a bitter civil war followed, one that saw the Goroans defeated and fleeing to the Eightpoints. They forged an alliance with the Everchosen, grudgingly embracing Chaos in the name of revenge.\n\nFor all their monstrous appearance, ogroids continue to exalt their former culture, corrupted as it now may be by Chaos. Their Theridon cohorts wield the traditional weapons of their people, tools that – along with the ogroids’ natural strength – can part even plate of meteoric iron. Yet bitterness has seized these creatures, constantly stoking their innate fury. On the battlefield, ogroids can fly into a berserk rage, tearing and maiming in truly gruesome displays that put the lie to any claim of true civilisation they might make.",

Broken Nadja is, for all her physical wasting, a gifted shaman capable of conjuring withering hexes. Her zealous servitude to the gods secretly vexes the sceptical chieftain, however – though Nadja is certain that Gunnar will one day come to acknowledge their majesty. Then there is Tanari, warrior queen of the Takblood tribe. Though the Brands and the Takblood are ancestral rivals, theirs is a combativeness based on respect; Tanari knows of Gunnar’s disdain for the gods, but she considers him blessed all the same. When a mutual enemy arises, Tanari will fight alongside Gunnar and his kin, if only to outmatch them blow for blow.",

The gods are fickle entities, liable to shower favour on any upstart that catches their gaze. To hold their attention requires escalating acts of evil in their name. A Warqueen relishes any chance to lead her tribal hordes against the bastions of civilisations, casting down their proud banners and burning their places of sanctuary to ash.",

Whether ruling from a spiked Dreadhold or battling amidst the wastelands, a Chaos Lord eagerly embraces any test of their might. They are killers of the most terrible magnitude, burners of nations and eradicators of civilisations.\n\nExceptionally brutal Chaos Lords may seek to master a Karkadrak. These reptilian beasts possess scales as hard as duardin-forged steel, and the momentum of their charges can plough through a stone barricade. Only the rarely exposed underside of these beasts is vulnerable, and it is here a Chaos Lord must strike to subdue a Karkadrak. Most who try are crushed for their troubles; the few who are worthy gain a fearsome and nigh-on impervious steed to carry them into the bloodiest press of the melee.",

These manifestations emerge from flame-spewing fissures or piles of butchered dead, unfurling like the petals of an iron flower. Flames lick from their spars, and any who look upon them hear the laughter of the Dark Gods ringing in their ears. Doom-Sigils devour the souls of the slain, guzzling them down with no less hunger than the Dark Gods themselves. As they do so, they pulse with a malignant light – and the worshippers of Chaos find themselves empowered. This is not so much a blessing as a simple imperative by the Doom-Sigil, willing them to reap more souls for it to feed upon. Even so, the conjuring of this fell sorcery at a key moment can easily swing the momentum of battle.",

Though this may seem unwise, these magi consider such courses to be only prudent. After all, to develop their abilities through measured study risks being usurped by others not so reticent to grasp the power of the gods.\n\nSorcerer Lords glut themselves on the esoteric energy of Chaos, channelling it to empower their servants or sending it blazing towards the enemy in coruscating storms of warpfire. They view such powers as theirs to wield by right, and they scorn those who believe that the gods favour only the clumsy arts of the blade. Many Sorcerers have profound oracular talents, scrying the paths of the future in exchange for service from other champions of Chaos. If so inclined, such a mage may share a portion of their knowledge with useful underlings, granting them uncanny insight that may well postpone their doom.",

The Dark Creed claims that Archaon is a false king – a mortal granted power by the trinkets he carries but unworthy to bear the favour of the gods. Their patron, by contrast, was the first of the Daemon Princes, and the very skies have been cursed through his sinister will. It is a battle that must be undertaken in the shadows, for Archaon dominates vast swathes of the realms. Yet the Legionnaires share the patience of their Dark Master and are tireless in their efforts.\n\nCells of Chaos Legionnaires both serve in Be’lakor’s dedicated armies and fight amongst other Chaos hordes, whispering the tenets of their cult to any receptive ears. Their talent for subterfuge extends to confounding enemies as well, working to intercept orders or leave warriors suddenly isolated from their fellows. For Be’lakor’s legions, little is more satisfying than falling upon such vulnerable enemies and hacking them down with cruel blades and mauls.",

Upon the brow of these monstrous felines blinks a crimson third eye that stares into the recesses of the mind. A Sphiranx is a telepath and a thief of secrets that delights in plundering the consciousness of its victims for knowledge both mundane and magical. The force of its mental ransacking can leave warriors staggering and disoriented, easy prey to be clawed apart once the creature is done with them.\n\nSphiranxes were once native to Hysh. In times past, they served the Archmage Teclis, guarding repositories of arcane artefacts and lore; ruins across the Realm of Light still possess feline statuary that harks back to this accord. Yet though the Sphiranxes were wise, Teclis forbade them from developing the understanding needed to use the magics they guarded, sparking a jealous bitterness within them. In a moment of weakness, they swore a pact with the Lord of Flux, being granted their third eye and telepathic abilities – but the flood of knowledge they glutted themselves upon soon drove them mad. Forsaken by the Archmage, the Sphiranxes slunk into the Chaos-tainted wastes, assembling hoards of enchanted items in the hope of satisfying their esoteric cravings.",

Their blade is their only companion, save for the daemons that whisper in their ear. Such total devotion brings boons, without question. A Chaos Warrior is strong enough to tear a mortal’s head from their shoulders and wears plate as tough as meteoric iron. Yet in accepting these gifts, they have irrevocably set upon a road whose only possible ends are death, devolution or the fleeting possibility of apotheosis.\n\nChaos Warriors are an unyielding tide of iron that grinds across the field and bludgeons anyone foolish enough to linger in its path. Though each is ultimately concerned only with their own glory, Chaos Warriors are willing to work in unison to achieve victory – especially when the eyes of their champions are upon them. It is a form of brutal discipline that has seen them leave many battlefields carpeted with enemy dead.",

Though this may seem unwise, these magi consider such courses to be only prudent. After all, to develop their abilities through measured study risks being usurped by others not so reticent to grasp the power of the gods.\n\nThe most aggressive Sorcerer Lords are not content to be whispering viziers to the champions of Chaos; they desire to command hordes, to see enemies terrified and broken before them. So do they seek out the winged alpha predators known as Manticores, arcanely forcing these beasts into service. Though these seers possess subtlety enough to glean the paths of the future, they prefer utilising their powers in far more grandiose displays. With hissed incantations, they rip through the skin of reality, blasting foes to ashes and sending their screaming souls into the abyss of the Realm of Chaos.",

Jagged spikes of metal and rock will rip the earth from below, impaling any nearby. These protrusions will then carve forwards without relent, occasionally retracting before springing forth again, their angry force redoubled.\n\nEven the shamans of the Chaotic tribes will not lightly conjure a Realmscourge Rupture. Quite aside from the physical mutilation it demands, this spell inflicts lasting devastation on the lands, its very presence piercing and warping the ecosystem. It takes a mage with true contempt for all but their own ascension to dabble with such magics – and theirs are the souls the gods of Chaos delight in most thoroughly, cackling each time the caster inflicts torment upon the realms to achieve their desires.",

They intend to carve out a place for themselves in the greatest Chaos hosts, and many warbands have travelled to the Eightpoints to offer their blades at the foot of the Everchosen’s throne.\n\nThough they have their own champions, each Savager warband will ultimately mass around the Godspeakers, those tribal elders who have been granted a degree of prophetic powers by the Dark Gods. It is these seers who interpret the whims of the Chaos Pantheon, which often involve the capture and desecration of sites of particular arcane power. The Savagers fear failing in these vows to the gods far more than the blade of any foe. They will fight beyond the point of mortal injury to claim such ground, knowing that their deities look favourably on those who battle without fear and scorn any who show a hint of hesitation.",

Whether ruling from a spiked Dreadhold or battling amidst the wastelands, a Chaos Lord eagerly embraces any test of their might. They are killers of the most terrible magnitude, burners of nations and eradicators of civilisations.\n\nChaos Lords lead from the front. To do any less would see them stripped of divine favour. No normal steed will suffice for them; they ride daemonic beasts, creatures granted to them by their patrons as a reward. Daemonic Mounts often appear as mutated flame-snorting warhorses, but some are reptilian or avian in nature – or even stranger still. With such a mount, a Chaos Lord leads thundering charges into the enemy, trampling them beneath a stampede of ironshod hooves.",

Many bear especially baroque or grotesque armour, while some have claw-limbed mutations they view as worthy gifts. All are skilled warriors, more than equal to several lesser mortals. The weapons they carry are said to rip the soul from its mortal housing, delivering it into the waiting and hungry maws of the Chaos Gods.\n\nChaos Chosen often form the entourage of a Chaos Lord or are their most trusted and deadly linebreakers. These armour-clad brutes plough into concentrations of enemy soldiery, laughing contemptuously at each panicked sword-blow or spear-thrust that fails to harm them. In turn, each swing of a Chosen’s soul splitter reaps a terrible toll in lives. Throughout these acts of butchery, the Chosen keep watch for those most formidable enemies whose destruction might draw the gaze of the gods anew and see them elevated to even greater power.",

Yet Be’lakor is a creature of matchless cunning; even as he raged at his predicament, nursing hatred for the ‘False King’ Archaon, he schemed to reclaim his place at the forefront of the hordes of Chaos.\n\nBe’lakor prefers to work in the shadows, orchestrating manipulations over decades. Most infamous of his schemes was the genesis of the Cursed Skies, clouds of corruption that spill across the heavens and can even prevent the souls of slain Stormcasts from returning to Azyr. When the Dark Master takes to the field in person, he is a force to be reckoned with. Through sorcery and guileful whispers, he leaves ordered battlelines in milling disarray, or he engineers events to ensure they never arrive at all. Those few who stand firm are swiftly bisected, body and soul, by the Blade of Shadows. The terror of mortals is as the sweetest nectar to Be’lakor, who takes it as proof of his own supremacy.",

Enemies not cleaved, spitted or otherwise shredded by these implements are trampled by the creature’s iron-hard hooves. It would be easy to dismiss the Centaurions as base beasts, and it is true that they are often encountered in fighting pits dedicated to the Ruinous Power. Yet Centaurions possess surprising cunning and subtlety. Moreover, they are beings with a purpose – to cast down Archaon and, in his place, raise up Be’lakor, the Dark Master.\n\nHow Be’lakor came to command the Centaurions is unclear. Some say he forged some deal with their ancestors; others say that the first Daemon Prince had some direct hand in their creation. Either way, the Centaurions serve him with brutal loyalty. Each Marshal can each call upon cells of Be’lakor’s agents to do their bidding, and warriors who catch their attention in the fighting pit are targeted for initiation into the Legion of the First Prince. Many would-be initiates are swayed by the Centaurions’ promises of power; those more truculent are violently compelled to stare into the eyes of an Icon of the Dark Master, hollowing them out and turning them into vessels of the daemon’s will for the Centaurions to direct.",

The Everchosen’s obsessive hatred for all deities, even his own ruinous patrons, seemed to blind him to the perils his dark empire faced – the mark of an unworthy king. Atarus sought a new patron, one who truly bathed in the favour of Chaos. He found it in Be’lakor. Pledging himself to the first Daemon Prince, Atarus was carried into the Cursed Skies, bathed in the soul-energies trapped there. He was reborn as Eternus, a creature of dark lightning who would reform from the hellish storm if slain.\n\nEternus commands the Legion of the First Prince on his new liege’s behalf, spitting opponents on his crackling glaive. He also oversees the networks of spies that serve the Dark Master; Eternus is both eloquent and merciless, and he has lured many into Be’lakor’s service. This commitment is born as much through dread as hatred for Archaon, for Eternus knows that Be’lakor could strip away his false immortality should he no longer prove useful, leaving him little more than a raving lightning-gheist.",

Though he swears oaths in exchange for the power to protect his tribe, Gunnar privately despises the gods, believing that their influence over mortals amounts to nothing less than tyranny. Those who abandon their humanity to court their attention are foul to him – including his own brother, Jorvik, with whom he clashed after discovering the former chieftain offering sacrifices of their own tribal kin.\n\nIt is not only the dark powers that Gunnar takes umbrage with. Sigmar is a false god also, and many times have the Brands and their allies fought the God-King’s people. Yet he reserves the greatest of his scorn for the Skaven, whose schemes destroyed much of his homeland. Gunnar now leads a swelling tribal horde against both ratmen and Dawners intent on reclamation, treading a perilous path along the edge of damnation.",

They are the scavenger-packs of the infernal realm, though they are driven not by predatory hunger but by a need to maim and wound for its own sake. Their bat-winged flocks can be observed circling the towers of Chaos-held fortresses across the realms, shrieking and babbling in twisted snippets of the Dark Tongue. Chaos Furies are treacherous and conniving beings, entirely driven by self-interest. Though a champion can intimidate or cajole them into serving as messengers, dexterous thieves or even assassins, the daemons will always keep an eye peeled for opportunities for perfidy.\n\nChaos Furies abhor the notion of honourable combat. They are raiders by nature, descending in a storm of flapping wings to stab at unprotected and unaware enemies with their sharpened daggers. The moment that meaningful resistance begins to form, the daemons will wing away, cackling to themselves in cruel glee. They will return to hovering above the battlefield, gnawing on any treasure they have plundered and watching the carnage, before the urge to wreak malice seizes them completely once more.",

It is a manifestation of primal malice that, if not supplied with sacrifices, will soon turn upon its fellows. Most Darkoath consider the Wilderfiends to be heralds of the Ruinous Powers, but the truth is far darker. Each was once a hero of the tribes, but at some point in their attempts to fulfil increasingly grander and more terrible oaths to the gods, they faltered – and were punished for it. Their limbs elongated, their spine curled and antlers burst from their skull as they screamed and writhed in agony. Eventually, a creature more beast than man emerged from the gore-splattered ruins of splintered bone and shed skin, its eyes retaining a flicker of cold sentience. A Wilderfiend is bound to stalk behind its clan, acting as both watchful sentinel and ravenous predator.\n\nFor all its loathsome nature, a Wilderfiend is granted might through its transformation. It is innately sorcerous, able to summon rings of evil flames with an instinctive gesture. In its presence, grass withers and minds are struck by horror. A Wilderfiend uses these abilities to both destroy threats to its clan and hideously chastise those who fail to appease it with gifts; either will suffice, so long as its own appetites are sated.",

It is considered a great honour to make war from a chariot, for these constructs are as pulpits from which the murderous will of the Dark Gods can be enacted.\n\nOnly the most brutal of champions can hope to yoke one of the grotesque Gorebeasts to their will. These unnatural creatures lie somewhere between a monstrous simian and a Ghurish rokodile, and one swing of their fists can punch clean through a mortal’s chest. Once bludgeoned into submission, a Gorebeast’s strength allows them to pull a Chaos Chariot with relative ease. It is often more difficult to get the creature to stop, as they smash aside enemy regiments and barrel onwards in search of more foes to crush.",

The form of this omen varies: the champion may glimpse the Everchosen’s mark amidst an inferno, or spraying blood may form a silhouette of their would-be master’s crown. They must then travel to the Varanspire, Archaon’s dread fortress, while undergoing grim and bespoke labours that push each aspirant beyond the former limits of their strength and loyalty to the Three-Eyed King. Few survive, but those who do are mightily empowered, rewarded with a daemonic steed and formed into warbands that crush enemies beneath stampedes of fury and iron.\n\nThe Varanguard are divided into Eight Circles, each of which possesses its own sanctums within the Varanspire and serves Archaon in a different fashion. Many still bear the marks and boons of the gods they once served, though loyalty to the Everchosen has – in theory – come to supplant all. Few servants of Chaos would defy a Varanguard, for they speak with their master’s voice, and they would wield their runeblades until the stars themselves turned cold if he demanded it of them.",
