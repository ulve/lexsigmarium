      "lore": "Priests of Khorne who utter vows of vengeance against wizards may call forth Hexgorger Skulls from the Realm of Chaos. These manifestations take the form of a pair of giant flayed skulls, blood pouring from their eye sockets. They drift with a predatory menace, seeking the tang of sorcery. When spellcraft is detected, the Skulls disgorge blood in a ferocious torrent. In their presence, even the mightiest incantations gutter out. The sight of these bleeding death’s heads has seen many mages reduced to gibbering terror as Khorne’s chosen hack them apart.\n\nAmongst the most infamous tales regarding the Hexgorger Skulls was the case of Ghyrrus Thrin. A skilled interpreter of astral confluences, Thrin’s arcane predictions had seen the garrison of Gram’s Redoubt – a vital strongpoint in the southern Brimstone Peninsula – repel Khornate warbands on numerous occasions. Yet when the moon known as Orb Infernia reached its apex that year, Thrin’s predictions grew unnerving, fixating on floating skulls watching him from afar. One night, Thrin was found missing from his tower. His corpse was discovered a mile or two from the walls, lungs pumped full of clotted blood. Gram’s Redoubt was overrun soon after, and Sigmarite control in the local region collapsed.",

Through their chanting, they wreathe their flock’s weapons in infernal fires, render their flesh as living and inviolate bronze, and call forth manifestations of the Lord of Battle’s anger directly from the Realm of Chaos.\n\nTo conflate a Slaughterpriest with a wizard would soon see the offender hacked apart in a frenzy. These champions do not manipulate aetheric energies in the manner of some craven mage; rather, they open their souls to the Blood God, becoming a conduit for his world-warping rage. Such contact with the furious divine would soon consume even the most fervent of worshippers. To bolster themselves, Slaughterpriests draw upon the power inherent in sacrifice; they will drink the blood of their victims and carve great wounds upon their own flesh. With such offerings do they gird their souls to bear Khorne’s touch.",

They were seized by the Blood God’s followers and dragged before his altars, where they were melded together and twisted into predatory forms more pleasing to his gaze. Khorgoraths are lumpen misbegots whose every moment is torment. Their bodies spasm with overwrought musculature, and their innards twist with endless hunger – a hunger not for flesh but for skulls. With an ear-rending howl, Khorgoraths leap upon their prey in ungainly fashion, tentaclelike appendages whipping out to twist and rip off heads before stuffing them into gnashing fanged maws. Any unfortunate enough to witness one of these beasts in a frenzy of consumption is marked by the experience for evermore.\n\nKhorgoraths prowl the territories of the Bloodbound in a mindless state of hunger, salivating and heaving with the need to consume. When battle calls, it is the Bloodstokers who will typically direct them to the front, the lashing of their whips speaking to the animal instincts still buried within the poor creatures. Other lords keep Khorgoraths far closer, using them as guardian beasts that will rip apart petitioners and rivals with but a word from their master.",

Each of these greater daemons belongs to one of eight hosts, with its own preferred methods of murder-making. Brutal competition exists between Bloodthirsters to ascend through these hosts, just as Khorne desires.\n\nBloodthirsters of the Third Host are permitted to dub themselves the Wrath of Khorne. They are hurled into the choicest engagements, driving the god’s hosts to red victory through their own displays of slaughter. Bloodthirsters of a less favoured host often find themselves subordinate to a Wrath of Khorne, however much it rankles. With axe and flail swinging, hellfire spilling from its maw with each bellow, a Wrath of Khorne Bloodthirster is a tyrannical marshal indeed, but one who will make any sacrifice to excel under its master’s gaze.",

They stab and hack until they are covered in the gore of both friend and foe, heedless of danger and determined to win Khorne’s favour or die trying. When the Bloodreavers mass in great numbers and crash against the foe, shieldwalls crumble and armies collapse.\n\nMany Bloodreavers were once tribesfolk who went down darker paths of battle and bloodshed; others were former Sigmarites lured into the Lord of Battle’s service by their own war-hunger. Yet there is another, more infamous way that they recruit new warriors: the Dark Feast. In the aftermath of battle, captives who have fought well will be offered a choice by the Bloodbound – brutal death or to consume the flesh of their own butchered comrades. Those who choose the latter are damned. With each bite, their disgust fades as Khorne claims more of their soul. Soon they are one more frothing Bloodreaver, lost in a cannibalistic furore.",

A Wrathmonger’s blood boils with that forbidden strength, lending them might enough to swing their bludgeoning flails as if they weighed nothing, and from them exudes an aura of fury so overwhelming that it seizes both friend and foe. Homicidal madness is a Wrathmonger’s constant companion – one that they embrace wholeheartedly.\n\nWrathmongers cannot be truly commanded, even by the most vaunted of champions. Khorne is their only true master, and the spreading of his allconsuming fury is their driving goal. A hot arterial stink surrounds them at all times, for blood oozes from their pores as a crimson mist. It is this vapour that drives sane warriors out of their minds with outrage and funnels new souls into Khorne’s grasp. It also renders the skin of the Wrathmongers perpetually ruddy, until they more closely resemble the daemons of the Blood Legions than their fellow mortals.",

Skulls erupt from the ground to mass around their base, and anger chokes the air around them like a heat haze. Skull Altars often form the heart of Bloodbound warcamps, and to claim such a structure is a worthy ambition for any mortal champion. Even daemons covet the Skull Altars, for they are a tangible link to the realm of their master.\n\nAs shards of the Realm of Chaos made manifest, Skull Altars are laden with ritualistic energy. Through the offering of blood and the speaking of slaughterous invocations, a disciple of Khorne can harness this power with greater ease than ever.

In his matchless zeal, Skarbrand serves Khorne more completely than ever, and foes from the Stormcast Eternals to the celestial Seraphon have known the bite of his axes.",

Combat is their driving obsession, consuming their every thought; anger boils constantly through their veins, and they find fleeting satisfaction only in the moment of the decapitating strike. This total devotion to war is made manifest in each Bloodletter’s hellblade – a jagged sword tied with their very essence that blazes hotter as the daemon’s outrage grows.\n\nWhen first seen on the march, Bloodletters may appear to be the most martially organised of daemons. They stomp forwards in recognisable ranks, marshalling to the clarion of brazen horns and beneath banners that drip with gore. Long tongues flicking at the air, as if tasting the impending massacre, they can be entrusted to heed the growled commands of their overlords – at least, until the blood begins to flow. When that happens, the Bloodletters become nigh-on uncontrollable. All semblance of cohesion breaks as they lope forwards in a howling mob, tearing at one another to be first to plunge their blades deep into the flesh of mortal prey.",

To attain the might of the Skullreapers, an aspirant must embark on the Trial of Skulls. Few better examples of Khorne’s unstinting creed exist. While the specific rituals of the Trial vary across the realms, the meat of the matter is always the same; each day they must take eight skulls in open conflict, without fail, or be struck by their god’s displeasure.\n\nSkullreapers are offered great strength for their commitment and fervour. Even those who should fail to make their quota may at first only be ‘blessed’ with mutations that render them even more lethal. In the back of their minds, however, forever lurks the fear of being devolved into some mewling hellspawn – a fate without honour in Khorne’s eyes. Skullreapers target the largest concentrations of enemy that they can find, ploughing into the fray without hesitation. With each furious, decapitating swing, they move a step closer to Khorne’s favour.",

As a Blood Throne devours the bodies of the slain, an infernal power pulses through its brass superstructure, feeding into the Herald that has chained itself to its apex.

Any tactical order collapses in the presence of a Bleeding Icon, as the Blood God’s demands fill the battle-wearied minds of warriors. Should a mortal gaze into the reflective brass surface of the Icon for too long, they will glimpse themselves at their most bestial and base, a vision of what they could become through service to Khorne.

So potent is this ire that it twists the world around a Bloodthirster. Jagged spires of brass erupt from the ground at their passing, and lakes of blood bubble in the craters left by their hooves. Each of these greater daemons belongs to one of eight hosts, with its own preferred methods of murder-making. Brutal competition exists between Bloodthirsters to ascend through these hosts, just as Khorne desires.\n\nBloodthirsters of Unfettered Fury belong to the Eighth Host. Though the most numerous of Khorne’s greater daemons, they remain profoundly deadly; their axes have ended many a hero, while their cruel lashes stoke the fury of the Blood God’s worshippers. Beyond rejoicing in slaughter, the Eighth Host are tasked with expanding the Skull Lands and marshalling the hosts of Khorne’s lesser daemons. With bellows of fury and lashes of their spike-studded whips, they drive the Blood Legions onwards to new atrocities.",

The carnage they wreak is such that many champions permit them the honour of first blood. The greatest honour for any such cultist is to battle alongside a Flesh Hound – or else to slay such a daemon after beating them to their quarry. Those who achieve this latter feat are transformed into slavering daemonkin known as Hounds of Wrath, loping forward on all fours to tear foes apart with their bare hands.",

Other worshippers of the Blood God establish camps around holy sites created by these manifestations. Mountains split down the middle, horrifically disfigured ancient statues, the bones of decapitated titans: all these are seen as stark proof that Khorne’s incarnate fury can slay any foe.",

It is a phenomenon that has driven many to madness, a primal fear that reaches deep into the soul. Ritual and rite are little defence, owing to their blessed brass collars and claws that excel in shredding the flesh of wizards, and the daemons are utterly tireless. Even Bloodthisters can do little to control a Flesh Hound pack; they hunt as they will, consumed by Khorne’s raging vengeance.",

Wielding Blades of Blood forged by infernal artificers, Heralds of Khorne are conduits of their god’s fury, enacting his will through their furious commands.\n\nBloodmasters lead the daemonic cohorts from the front, commanding through setting a brutal example. Their talents lie in the cut and thrust of combat, and though they have an innate sense for battle’s flow, they primarily harness this to know when to set upon a reeling foe. A Bloodmaster’s rage is tectonic even for one of Khorne’s daemons. They are never still, forever pacing and hissing even in the scant moments between conflicts, talons flexing restlessly around the grip of their blades. Battle offers an outlet for their volcanic wrath, but it is hardly a reprieve; blood constantly drips from the prongs of their swords, soon causing their rage and battle-hunger to flare once more.",

Though as lethally capable as any Bloodbound marauder, they see the taking of lives as tedious. Rather, they would cut the throat of the realms and see geysers of liquid earthblood gush forth. A Realmgore Ritualist knows the runes of desecration that will develop into splintering world-wounds and the invocations that will call forth waves of gore. As ichor flows in rivers and rains from the sky, a murder-trance seizes nearby Bloodbound, seeing them abandon their last vestiges of restraint.\n\nA Ritualist’s ceremonies can only be performed with a blade thoroughly wetted in mortal blood. Prisoners will be sacrificed without pause to provide this sacred libation, but blood taken in honest battle is more pleasing to Khorne. The sacrificial daggers wielded by the Realmgore Ritualists are relics anointed in atrocity, and merely a single cut from such a weapon can see a foe rapidly and violently exsanguinated.",

A Lord of Khorne can inevitably be found in the thickest of melees, cleaving and hewing through the foe with wanton abandon. Their red-handed example stokes the fury of their followers to new heights, for where a Lord of Khorne fights, the Blood God’s eye is never far away.\n\nThe most unsubtle Lords of Khorne draw the attention of the Juggernauts – clanking and bestial daemons akin to sentient battering rams. Should the champion succeed in breaking one of these ironshod entities to their will, they will become a true force of destruction. Many style themselves as the grand masters of knightly orders sworn to Khorne’s tenets, but there is nothing chivalric about them; their one desire, and that of the Skullcrushers they lead in great Brass Stampedes, is to trample entire armies into oblivion.",

As befitting a member of their lord’s Gorechosen elite, a Bloodstoker is themselves a potent warrior, but they like to boast that rather than fighting with a hammer or axe, they wield the warhorde itself as a weapon. In doing so, they amass harvests of skulls far in excess of even the most ferocious personal combatant.\n\nBloodstokers are habitually sadistic, sending warriors and beasts to their death without hesitation and revelling as their whips flay flesh from bone. Worshippers of Khorne who have known the bite of a Bloodstoker’s lash often mutter that these champions would find equal acclaim amongst the pain-cultists of decadent, despised Slaanesh. Yet a Bloodstoker acts solely to intensify the slaughter, and the boon they offer to a champion of Khorne renders them invaluable, granting them licence to inflict agony without restraint.",

Each has earned their position through acts of carnage; they have levelled cities, eviscerated their rivals and piled skulls to the sky in reverence. A Lord of Khorne can inevitably be found in the thickest of melees, cleaving and hewing through the foe with wanton abandon. Their red-handed example stokes the fury of their followers to new heights, for where a Lord of Khorne fights, the Blood God’s eye is never far away.\n\nMany are the gifts that Khorne’s champions may receive for carrying out worthy massacres in his name. Their scarred bodies bulge with muscle, onto which is fused armour that hungrily drinks the sprayed blood of the slain. In claw-like hands, they carry axes forged in the fires of Khorne’s own infernal citadel. Should they truly excel, they may find a Flesh Hound coming to slink at their side – daemons that are a mark of the Blood God’s favour and hunger to devour wizards alive.",

When finally he was vanquished by some nameless adversary, not even death could stay the ultimate berserker. On some forlorn battlefield, the Slaughterborn rose from a pool of heroes’ blood, his rebirth consecrated in an explosion of gore – and his hunger for carnage undiminished.\n\nSkarr’s immortality through battle has seen him become a blight on the realms. There is no set period in which his crimson resurrection occurs. Sometimes the Slaughterborn vanishes for years after falling; sometimes he returns in mere moments. Yet, eventually, return he always does. Skarr’s psychotic fury is a beacon to fellow Bloodbound, who travel for leagues to fight alongside him. Wrathmongers in particular feel a kinship with Skarr, often acting as an impromptu retinue – though the Slaughterborn pays them less than no mind as he kills and kills again.",

Crafted in the forges that burn within the god’s Brass Citadel, these sentient artillery pieces are as thirsty for carnage as any of their fellow daemons. Skull Cannons rumble forwards while revving and snarling, protruding jaws snapping wildly. Bloodletters – often those who forged the abomination – cling to the weapon’s spiked ridges, helping to direct the long brass barrel that emerges from its ‘neck’. From here is shot the cannon’s payload: the skulls of the foe, covered in pitch of boiling blood before being set alight. Upon striking their target, they explode with terrible force, reducing foes to smears of gore.\n\nTypical of Khorne’s single-minded fixation, Skull Cannons reload by inflicting death. As their spiked wheels crush enemies and their mouths tear flesh apart, the foe’s skulls are sucked into the device’s innards, ready to be fired. Each impact from such a projectile echoes like the roar of the Blood God, and when massed in cohorts, Skull Cannons have the power to level fortress walls, the engines roaring through the breach to join the slaughter.",

These creatures are drawn to the most destructive of those warriors – those who crush and dismember as a matter of course. Smashing clear of their stockades in Khorne’s realm, they will charge across the cosmos until they locate the object of their fixation. The warrior then has eight heartbeats to form an accord with and mount the daemon. If they hesitate, they will be gored to death.\n\nSkullcrusher warbands often style themselves as vagabond warriors, nomadic slayers forever crossing the realms in search of new challenges. Their daemonic steeds need neither rest nor sustenance, crunching tirelessly through deep snow or over endless deserts to find new battlefields.

Those who accept his challenge see that accursed sword raised in salute – before Skulltaker summarily eviscerates them. He is Khorne’s eternal champion, rage channelled as lethal precision, every strike calculated to sever the foe’s head. When battle is done, Skulltaker returns to the Brass Citadel, offering his new trophy to his god in supplication. On occasion, Khorne will allow his executioner to keep the heads of especially noteworthy foes. These are flensed fastidiously by Skulltaker, before being added to the cloak that marks his grim purpose.\n\nIn his hunt for the most formidable enemies, Skulltaker has fought across reality and beyond, from atop perilous ice floes to the ramparts of impossible fortresses. He often travels alone, finding the constant raging of his fellows a tedious distraction. Even Bloodthirsters cannot command Khorne’s champion; those who try are fixed with a volcanic glower and a warning twitch of the Slayer Sword. For Skulltaker, only his next ordained kill matters. Anyone who would slow him – ally or adversary – is cut down without hesitation.",

Rather, a soul chosen by Khorne will undergo the harrowing Red Baptism. The god’s favour will manifest as their skin becomes coated in scalding blood. This then scabs over and hardens into plate, and for the remainder of their days, a boundless battle fury will seize the wearer. Blood Warriors typically emerge from a Bloodbound tribe, but not always. Even one who has fought against a Khornate army may on rare occasion be subjected to the Red Baptism if Khorne looks on them approvingly.",

Their battle-lust is so profound that it borders on the elemental, and though they acknowledge that Khorne relishes all forms of conflict, they see personal advancement as a distraction from the business of righteous slaughter. This aloofness, however, does not mean that a Lord of Khorne can trust their Bloodsecrator. If they believe another champion to be more favoured by the god, these icon bearers will not hesitate to depose their former master.",

Brutal competition exists between Bloodthirsters to ascend through these hosts, just as Khorne desires.\n\nOnly the most mindlessly inchoate of daemons are mustered as part of the Sixth Host. These are the Bloodthirsters of Insensate Rage, bringers and disciples of the most atrocious forms of violence. With sinews bulging, they heft their Great Axes of Khorne – weapons tall as a fortress gate and forged with such fury that they can bisect a Stegadon in one terrible swing. What these weapons, wielded by such utterly battle-mad daemons, can do to ranks of lesser warriors is best left unconsidered…",

An Aspiring Deathbringer marches at the forefront of the Bloodbound advance, followed by baying packs of warriors who have thrown in their lot with these rising champions. No fear or doubt drags at their steps; offering their lives in Khorne’s service is a thousand times preferable to ignominy.\n\nAn Aspiring Deathbringer’s every waking thought is consumed by the need to advance along the crimson path. They have given themselves to Khorne body and soul, and there can be no turning back; glory, oblivion or mutation into something less than human are their only remaining fates. Canny lords of Khorne sharpen this mania by carefully balancing slights against the Deathbringer’s pride with opportunities to earn renown. There are few foes more ferocious, after all, than an Aspiring Deathbringer who sees a chance to ascend another rung of the blood-stained ladder of glory.",

They are relied upon to oversee key portions of the battlefield, but the Deathbringers make no secret of their hunger for glory and know that it is best earned within sight of the mighty. Wherever possible, they will fight at their master’s side, pushing themselves to new extremes of bloodshed. Khorne’s faithful are firm advocates for keeping one’s worthiest enemies close. Should the lord of the warhorde fall, it is the Exalted Deathbringers who are best placed to seize control. If their master endures, the Deathbringer must eventually challenge them for rulership in a fight to the death. Better to have had a chance to observe the tactics of their foe up close beforehand…",

This alpha Flesh Hound is unleashed when an enemy has earned Khorne’s personal displeasure. Each of Karanak’s heads tracks its quarry in a different fashion. The first senses across space, following the spoor of the target no matter where they hide. The second follows through time, seeing both those who try to hide in the recesses of history as well as those who will incite Khorne’s rage in the future. The third head is the most dangerous, for it tracks its prey from within their own mind.\n\nKaranak has little inclination to lead armies; his only goal is to drag his quarry back to the base of the Skull Throne, where they will be torn apart under Khorne’s glowering gaze. Even so, where he lopes, other warriors of Khorne follow – for Karanak’s hunts take him through the most furious of battles. Accompanied by packs of slavering Flesh Hounds compelled to join the pursuit, Karanak chases down his prey without remorse or relent, as indefatigable as a falling axe.",

Wielding Blades of Blood forged by infernal artificers, Heralds of Khorne are conduits of their god’s fury, enacting his will through their furious commands.\n\nThose Heralds designated as Skullmasters display an impulsive aggression above and beyond the manic standard of Khorne’s daemons. Such is necessary to master one of the snorting daemon-beasts known as Juggernauts. It is the Skullmasters who lead cavalry charges of Bloodcrushers, attempting to direct these unsubtle brass stampedes with something approaching tactical nous. As their title implies, Skullmasters have a particular fascination with the taking of heads. As their Juggernaut mounts thunder towards the foe at surprising speed, the Heralds are wont to angle their blades like the edge of a scythe, trusting in murderous momentum to hew a harvest of skulls from necks.",

The daemon must outwit or outfight the beast so that it ends up on the Juggernaut’s back – or else be gored into oblivion. Those who succeed crash free from the Brass Citadel in possession of a formidable new mount.\n\nBloodcrushers are amongst the most unsubtle of Khorne’s warriors, which renders them truly a sight to behold. The fact that Juggernauts cannot truly be broken, and that it is they rather than their riders who decide where to charge into battle, is largely immaterial to the Bloodletters; after all, Juggernauts hunger for battle no less than any other of the War God’s servants. Protected by the Juggernaut’s metal hide, a Bloodcrusher uses its own mass as a profound weapon, smashing those foolish enough to stand in its path into flinders.",
