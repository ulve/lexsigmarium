      "lore": "Pusgoyle Blightlords are the droning vanguard of a Maggotkin horde’s advance. Mounted upon buzzing Rot Flies, they spread destruction in the manner of an especially virulent pathogen. Descending from above upon entrenched or defiant enemies, the Blightlords and their daemonic steeds crash home like the sudden tolling of a dirge-bell. Some will take this metaphor more literally, attaching heavy tocsins to their mount’s thorax and using the momentum to turn them into bludgeoning tools of slaughter.\n\nBlightlords are amongst the most devoted of Nurgle’s mortal warriors. Each has undergone a hideous rite known as the Feast of Maggots, in which they allow daemonic slathermaggots to infest their body. They then have seven days in which to infect worshippers of Nurgle’s rival gods with slathermaggot spawn, or else they will be devoured from within. Should they succeed, a Rot Fly – a daemon formed from bitterness and rejection – will emerge from the Garden, consenting to serve as their mount. Blightlords are often curiously fond of their steed, even beyond the respect Nurgle’s champions habitually display for his daemons. To harm a Rot Fly spurs them into a gurgling rage – one that often ends in the offender being filled to bursting with daemonic mites and ticks.",

The most sinister aspect of the Gnarlmaws, however, is also the least visible. Their distended roots burrow into the earth to anchor the entity to reality, sucking in natural magics and pumping out filth in turn. The manifestation of a Feculent Gnarlmaw can taint a land for years, turning it into a reflection-in-miniature of Nurgle’s Garden.\n\nFeculent Gnarlmaws emerge wherever Nurgle’s Maggotkin march in force, enticed by the vile scent of their souls. The noxious scents they emit and the clangour of the bells that hang from their limbs can cheer even the most despondent of Plaguebearers. Enemies are not so bolstered; inhaling even a single spore from a Gnarlmaw can compel an atrocious death as new forms of infernal foliage bloom inside their bodies and devour them from within.",

Others took their first step unknowingly, having plumbed the wrong mouldering tome for lore or let their fear of bodily decay lead them into dark research. Whatever the case, a Rotbringer Sorcerer is a living vessel of corruption. Their souls are withered things, polluted by Nurgle’s rancid attention. Far from being weakened, a Sorcerer turns this corruption into an arcane weapon. Muttered incantations leave them before their jaws distend wide, spraying a noxious stream of bile and daemonic effluvia. Those who survive this barrage are sapped and weakened, with even magical defences fraying.\n\nSorcerers often serve as advisors to more militant champions of Nurgle, assisting in the summoning of daemons and withering magical wards to nothing. It is not unheard of for a gifted Sorcerer to command an entire host, however. As well as spreading sickness and despair with gusto, these forces delight in serving Nurgle through more esoteric means; they hunt down relics to corrupt, search for especially virulent plague ingredients and work to pollute the ley lines of power that race across the realms.",

Under its touch crops mutate, vegetation is reduced to festering mulch and mortals bloat with weeping, blistering pustules before bursting in gory showers. Those who survive the coming of the Deluge do so through embracing the munificence of the Rainfather and spreading his cult to lands further afield.\n\nRotigus is a masterful sorcerer, channelling putrescent magic through the downpours he summons. His spells inspire a most pustulant fecundity across lands watered by the Deluge, much as a farmer lavishes attention on their fields. Entire orchards of the Garden of Nurgle, and copses of daemonic trees set to sprouting across the realms, have known his life-giving touch, but the Rainfather believes that his work is never done. If there is one thing Rotigus cannot abide, it is the breaking of Nurgle’s gruesome cycles, and so he hates the undead with special vehemence, desiring to wash away their dust-dry kingdoms in a tide of filth.",

Surrounded by retinues of pus-dripping Blightkings, a Lord of Plagues trudges towards the most formidable warriors of the enemy host, huge cleavers gripped in their rot-eaten fingers. There is a logic to this, the champions believe: the corpses of the strongest foes will allow the greatest maladies to incubate within them. Besides, Nurgle is a proud god and smiles upon any who martially excel in his name.\n\nMany Lords of Plagues have their own peculiar rituals and idiosyncrasies when at war. Some speak only in sonorous rhymes, while others allow every seventh enemy to flee and spread warnings of woe. Some are sickeningly jolly, jesting with victims overcome by disease, while others are burdened with a great weariness that only divine service can alleviate. These quirks are often embraced and emulated by a Lord of Plague’s loyal warriors. Amongst warbands of Rotbringers, it is considered a position of honour to fight in the entourage of such a champion and thus be inspired as they reap life after life in the Grandfather’s service.",

Even more unnatural than a Beast of Nurgle’s appearance, however, is the joy that pervades these daemons. They are extremely, idiotically affectionate, always on the lookout for new playmates. Such is their enthusiasm that they cannot distinguish a mortal’s cries of pain as they dissolve from whoops of excitement.\n\nBeasts of Nurgle are one of the few breeds of daemon who truly lack any form of malice. This, however, does not diminish their lethal potential. Though they are far too excitable to follow orders or hold positions, the masters of the Plague Legions can always rely on the Beasts’ witless enthusiasm to create carnage. Beasts of Nurgle have little in the way of attention span, and become disappointed when the target of their affection becomes all still and boring – yet this is quickly rectified whenever the daemon spies another potential friend in the distance.",

The Murrain sees infected mortals slowly be overcome by nagging hysterics and the compulsion to dance and make merry, until their sides literally split or their hearts burst from exuberance. Daemons cannot perish through exertion alone, but the Murrain seizes control of their minds all the same, until whatever individuality they possessed is lost under newfound exuberance.\n\nBilepipers caper with a wild energy, drooling and grinning all the while. Their revolting quips and nauseating – in every sense of the word – wordplay leaves most daemons in fits of hysterics and buoyed with ebullient fervour. The dour Plaguebearers, meanwhile, fight harder to drown out such grating jocularity. Yet if the Murrain should ever go into remission, the Bilepipers find their noxious wit vastly diminished and the chortles of their compatriots growing increasingly strained. Should the daemon receive no laughter at all, they will agonisingly transform into a marotter and set of gutpipes for another Bilepiper to inherit.",

Upon being banished back to the Garden of Nurgle, it is enveloped in a swarm of flies, all while brooding upon its displeasure. Within this living cocoon, a monstrous metamorphosis occurs until the Beast has transformed into a Rot Fly, a creature entirely driven by the need to wreak vengeance.\n\nRot Flies are claimed as mounts by especially haughty Plaguebearers, who assemble into aerial shock cavalry known as Plague Drones. Though they serve their master faithfully enough, the Rot Flies view this as an alliance of convenience. By joining the Plague Legions, they gain more opportunities to enter the Mortal Realms, where their sole goal is to hunt down those who spurned their former incarnation. When they find their quarry, their malice reaches a fever pitch. If the spurner is lucky, they will merely be ripped apart or impaled upon slime-dripping stingers. If not, they will be swallowed by the Rot Fly, their body digested and their soul trapped within the daemon’s essence to suffer for eternity.",

This scribbling is interrupted only by nasal browbeatings or sneezes that spray forth showers of vile slime.

Nurgle’s tallymen stand firm and fight all the more determinedly under the gaze of these Heralds, else they risk being marked for forcible transformation into the lunatic, hideously cheerful Heralds known as Sloppity Bilepipers. The irony is that the Scriveners are often commanded to work in tandem with the Bilepipers, together motivating the Plague Legions through a mixture of threat and obnoxious whimsy. The grating antics of Nurgle’s jesters ensure that Scriveners are forever on the edge of murderous apoplexy, glad of any opportunity to let their tentacled jaws snap at enemies in a fury.",

They love to imitate their larger compatriots, be they daemons or trudging mortal champions. Most Maggotkin possess a great fondness for Nurglings, letting them nestle in folds of rancid flesh or scooping them out of harm’s way. The exception are the Plaguebearers, who are utterly vexed by the Nurglings and take any opportunity to give them a kicking – not that the cheerful little daemons mind.\n\nOn the battlefield, hordes of Nurglings waddle forwards in vomiting, squealing waves. Individually puny, they can be a terror when massed in great swarms, their poisonous bites and claws inflicting death by a thousand envenomed cuts. Given their small size, Nurglings are able to creep through even the smallest of confines, especially those too foul for mortals to investigate. They consider it a most enjoyable game to hide themselves in nooks and crannies before bursting out to assail enemies with toxic bites and scratches by the hundred.",

Their porous flesh is slick with diseased slime, and prehensile tongues lash from their pus-drooling maws. They are clear marks of Nurgle’s esteem, and each Maggoth Lord commands hordes of faithful as a result.\n\nThough Morbidex Twiceborn is a mortal, one would be forgiven for thinking otherwise. He resembles a giant armour-clad Nurgling, face permanently split in a rictus grin. Legend tells that such has been the case since he was buried beneath an avalanche of the daemonic imps whilst attempting to scale an unconquerable mountain. Trapped, Morbidex was confronted with endless inane riddles by the Nurglings. For each he failed to answer to their liking, he was further transformed to resemble the daemons. He continues to command the fascination of daemons, though he has long since ceased to wonder why this might be so, for his mind has rotted to giggling insanity. Wherever he rides, a repugnant carnival of disease follows as Nurgle’s diabolical scions caper and cavort in an effort to draw his attention.",

Though the Glottkin may fall on rare occasions, Nurgle can never remain irate with such cherished scions for long.

Jovial and gregarious, he is a masterful warrior despite his bulk. Ethrac, the middle sibling, is quite the opposite in temperament; an embittered soul who loudly criticises the decisions of his brothers and underlings, he is tolerated for his immense skill at plague-sorcery. The last and most physically imposing of the trio is Ghurk Glott. Once fair and meek, Nurgle has transformed him into a slow-witted leviathan upon whose shoulders his bickering siblings ride. Ghurk is capable of building terrible momentum on the charge, smashing open fortress gates or trampling all those in his path.",

Not even the Great Unclean Ones can recall a time before Horticulous roamed the virulent glades of Nurgle’s Garden. Any daemon who interferes with his labours is liable to be transformed into vile magical fertiliser or else fed to the molluscoid daemon-steed known as Mulch.\n\nNone can match Slimux’s capability in the propagation of new forms of diseased, daemonic plant-life. Feculent Gnarlmaws shiver at his passing, and when the Grand Cultivator is sent into the Mortal Realms, they burst through the veil of worlds with irrepressible eagerness. Such is Slimux’s skill in coaxing forth diseased foliage that he can bid the plants tunnel their roots through solid stone and steel, spreading the Garden of Nurgle with each emergence of foul life.",

Mounted upon a buzzing, ill-tempered Rot Fly, they lead flights of mounted warriors and daemons through the skies of the realms, frantic in their need to find untainted souls to corrupt. When a suitable target is sighted, the Lord of Afflictions leads their warriors to descend in a brutal, line-breaking charge. With filth-dripping trident, they lay about the foe, leaving those few who survive the initial onslaught broken in body and mind.\n\nEven this, however, does not spread disease swiftly enough for the liking of a Lord of Afflictions. So it is that they are driven to labour over the creation of an Incubatch, a totem crafted from a mortal corpse that radiates the most virulent of plagues. An Incubatch is the product of appalling rituals. To fashion such an entity requires the champion to barter away much of what remains of their soul. Some might even say that the Lords of Affliction fight so furiously in order to drown out the feeling of hollowness that eats at them constantly – though venturing as much before the champion would soon end in disaster.",

Indeed, the afflicted perish only after embracing the full misery of their condition, their despairing souls being transported to Nurgle’s Garden and remade as shambling lesser daemons.\n\nPlaguebearers are moribund and curmudgeonly. They consider being sent into the realms to be a terrible imposition and find the antics of their more jovial counterparts gruelling in the extreme. Yet Plaguebearers fulfil a vital role in Nurgle’s eyes. They are his tallymen, charged with numbering the diseases that spread across the realms, the clangs of dolorous tocsins and the daemon mites that caper amidst the filth. The only sound that can muffle their counting is the drone of the fat-bodied flies that accompany them, forming so thick a cloud that enemies have difficulty taking aim at the daemons from afar. The rot-eaten bodies of the Plaguebearers are no easier to harm up close, while their pus-dripping blades can sap strength from even the most vigorous of warriors.",

In return for their service, they have been granted command of a Pox Maggoth, a gargantuan beast with the head of a snapping maggot. Their porous flesh is slick with diseased slime, and prehensile tongues lash from their pus-drooling maws. They are clear marks of Nurgle’s esteem, and each Maggoth Lord commands hordes of faithful as a result.\n\nOrghotts Daemonspew is the most martial of the Maggoth Lords and the rider of the beast known as Whippermaw. Legend claims he was sired by a Great Unclean One through some unhallowed ritual, yet despite his grim parentage, he is not permitted to roam the Garden of Nurgle in the manner of a true daemon. This barring from paradise infuriates Daemonspew and has rendered him unflinchingly determined to impress Nurgle enough to earn true apotheosis. Wielding the feared Rotaxes, he leads vast hosts of mortal warriors into the most unrelenting slaughters, hoping to catch his god’s gaze through his ability to endure and the mountains of plague-ridden corpses he creates.",

In their view, their beloved god has given them the greatest gift of all, rotting their minds until they are inured to mortal maladies such as pain and fatigue. One would find it easier to inspire a Plaguebearer to mirth than compel a Blightking to give ground.\n\nBlightkings hail from all manner of origins, their past lives expunged as they are remade to fit Nurgle’s sickly fancies. Their arsenal – ranging from slime-coated scythes to rusted flails and more besides – is no less eclectic in nature. The sheer difficulty involved in slaying a Blightking has seen them pass through many battles, honing their skills until they are warriors far more dangerous than their bulk suggests. Even a small force of Blightkings can overwhelm more numerous enemies, chortling as they spread ruin and filth with each swing.",

They are the Rotmire Creed, and they are fanatical in spreading their deity’s vile gifts. In the Creed’s view, this is an act of utmost altruism; their teachings state that in decay and entropy lies the path to immortality. This search for eternal, unchanging life has consumed the Creed since its founding; its first members were forced to flee Sigmar’s cities into the swamps when their unnatural researches came to light.\n\nWarriors of the Rotmire Creed attack in a hail of darts coated and filled with diseased fluids. Their Witherlords distil such juices from the waters of the Rotmire; the bodies of those who perish here are dragged into vast, leaking corpse-idols by the cult’s Carrion Catchers. Living victims are often held captive amongst these midden heaps, their drawn-out suffering studied by the cult. The Creed’s elders remain obsessed with the search for immortality and have dispatched their cultists far and wide to seek out new ingredients for a foul elixir of life. Many of these warbands join with Maggotkin hosts, seeing in them true followers of Lord Leech’s will.",

Refusing to surrender, Spume leapt from the side of his stricken ship and into the abyssal depths, demanding rather than begging the boons of the gods as he pursued the beast. Nurgle watched the champion’s sheer reluctance to submit, even as his arm was ripped off by the dying kraken, with great amusement. When Gutrot washed ashore, his missing arm had been replaced by a cluster of filthy tentacles – a mark of the beast he had bested – and his mind was filled with visions of foetid glory.\n\nMany of Nurgle’s champions are phlegmatic in nature, but not so Gutrot Spume. He is aggressive and brash, obsessed with furthering his own name and legend, and when he leads his crew of blight-stricken reavers onto land, it is in search of worthy rivals to cast down. In battle, Spume uses the nimble flailing of his slick tentacles to disarm enemies of their blades before his monstrous cleaver takes off their heads.",

Rather, they serve as conduits for Nurgle’s own essence in the realms, summoning epidemics of woe through guttural invocation and grisly sacrifice.\n\nA Harbinger will channel malignant energies through a series of dreadful omens, each serving as ritual accelerants to magnify their god’s influence. Known collectively as the Seven Strokes of Doom, there is little uniformity in how these omens manifest. Tales are told of bells that drone night and day with no obvious source, fresh water congealing to pus and bile, and livestock simply collapsing before rapidly succumbing to decay. Only the first and final signs are consistent – the former being the Harbinger looming upon the far horizon, and the latter manifesting as the champion returning with scythe or grim tocsin held aloft, summoning epidemics of rust and decay to overcome the enemy.",

When a cadaver is ripe, the Lord of Blights will remove its head and patiently fill the skull with the pestilential seepage of daemons. These revolting death’s heads are hung from the Lord’s gallow-mount and generously handed out to warriors to hurl.\n\nEach Lord of Blights applies their own creativity to the production of death’s heads, experimenting with different dosages of daemon-gunk or binding them with curses. Nothing pleases such a champion more than to see their creations being used well; even while clubbing an enemy to a pulp, they will look up and give approving laughs as death’s heads sail through the air above. The horrendous labours of a Lord of Blights swaddles them in the energies of corruption, and even fine weapons soon blacken and decay in their presence.",

Some will take this metaphor more literally, attaching heavy tocsins to their mount’s thorax and using the momentum to turn them into bludgeoning tools of slaughter.\n\nBlightlords are amongst the most devoted of Nurgle’s mortal warriors. Each has undergone a hideous rite known as the Feast of Maggots, in which they allow daemonic slathermaggots to infest their body. They then have seven days in which to infect worshippers of Nurgle’s rival gods with slathermaggot spawn, or else they will be devoured from within. Should they succeed, a Rot Fly – a daemon formed from bitterness and rejection – will emerge from the Garden, consenting to serve as their mount. Blightlords are often curiously fond of their steed, even beyond the respect Nurgle’s champions habitually display for his daemons. To harm a Rot Fly spurs them into a gurgling rage – one that often ends in the offender being filled to bursting with daemonic mites and ticks.",
