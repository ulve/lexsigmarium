      "lore": "The warriors of the Auric Hearthguard are renowned for their steadfast bravery – holding ground no matter how dire the circumstances and facing even certain doom without abandoning their duty. They are tasked with guarding the forge-temple of their magmahold where ur-gold is stored and runes are forged. The absolute importance of this sacred site leads the Zharrgrim priesthood to handpick its guardians from the hold’s ranks, chosen for their implacability as much as their martial prowess. Small groups of them will often fight as bodyguards to the Zharrgrim priests, allowing their wards to safely retrieve more ur-gold deposits.\n\nOf course, warriors of the Auric Hearthguard are as fiery and belligerent as any of their kin. However, they channel their battle-fury not into wild swings and reckless charges but into focusing the flaming devastation of their favoured weapon: the magmapike. These ornate hand-cannons spew a ceaseless barrage of superheated lava at their target, each blazing missile capable of melting through plate armour and igniting hair and flesh. Should any foes survive this ferocious hail of magma and engage the Auric Hearthguard in combat, they will be quickly dispatched with the blades affixed to the edges and hafts of these formidable weapons.",

This may be due to the source of their power – dozens of ur-gold runes are embedded into their bodies, imbuing them with the strength of an inferno and the divine rage of Grimnir himself. Most Fyreslayers cannot bear more than a few ur-gold runes at a time, and only the few that survive and overcome the gruelling, often lethal, Tests of Wrath are said to have the soul of a Grimwrath. The only place they truly feel at peace is in the heart of battle, entering a state of such focused fury that their greataxe becomes a fiery blur of motion.",

With shouted tales of ancestral heroics, their own battle-joy swells until divine energy sparks out from them in waves. Any warriors around the Runesmiters are inspired by their rumbling chants, filling them with vigour and righteous fury. This causes their ur-gold runes to blaze and sparkle as Grimnir’s essence responds in kind, filling their bearers with fell-handed power.\n\nThe Runesmiters have a deep knowledge of metal and rock thanks to their affinity with their holy fires. As a result, many have developed other, more elemental powers. They can control magmic forces, summon cinderstorms, and even cloak the claws of Magmadroths in flame. Most crucially, they can command the tide of battle by melting through solid rock and boring temporary tunnels for their Fyreslayer kin to charge through, allowing them to strike from an unexpected quarter.",

Not even the most rash of lodge leaders would make decisions on matters of ur-gold or war without first consulting their Runemaster.

By slamming the base of their staff upon the ground, the battlefield cracks asunder and magma surges up to consume the foe. The Runemaster can also conjure walls of white-hot incandescence from the molten depths to block the advance of invaders.",

This mystic furnace can be summoned to a battlefield, where its elemental heat can ignite ur-gold runes and stoke the powers of the Zharrgrim.\n\nDrawing upon the powerful elemental energies burning within the Magmic Battleforge, a Zharrgrim priest casts clouds of cinders adrift on the air, imbuing those of their sacred order with power afresh.

Despite their funerary obligations, like any other Fyreslayer, the Flamekeepers are formidable warriors. They take to battle in the most dire of circumstances, where their kin seek to emulate Grimnir’s last stand against his nemesis Vulcatrix.\n\nEach Flamekeeper carries a Masterflame Rune, a simmering ember of the First Fire that erupted in the wake of Grimnir’s shattering. Whenever a Fyreslayer warrior falls in proximity to this artefact, the blazing power within them is drawn forth; the ur-gold hammered into their body glows with a blinding light as their flesh and spirit is returned to the flames. A Flamekeeper can channel this force to bolster the runes of their brethren who remain in the fight, imbuing them with a stubborn resolve to annihilate their enemies and setting their fyresteel weapons alight.",

They are not deathseekers, but agents of retribution, determined to ensure the legacy of their people survives.\n\nWhen battle is joined, Grimhold Exiles transform into roaring agents of vengeance, with each blow from their hammers carrying Grimnir’s own blazing wrath. An Exile’s hammers are imbued with a portion of the Zharrkhul – the legendary Master Flame, ignited during the ancestor-god’s violent demise, that burns at the heart of each magmahold. Along with the ur-gold runes they stamp into their bodies, the Master Flame is the closest connection Grimnir’s cult have to their fallen deity. Some Grimhold Exiles seek to one day found a new magmahold, using the fragment of the Zharrkhul they carry to light the forge temple at such a stronghold’s heart. All Grimhold Exiles swiftly grow into formidable warriors – their ur-gold runes seem to blaze all the brighter, as if the deepest reserves of power locked within are coaxed out by the glow of the Master Flame.",

Those who survive are allowed to pledge their oath of service, and in return are gifted their fireblessed weapon from the Runefather himself.

These elite warriors are bodyguards to the royal family – the Auric Runefather and his Runesons. Hearthguard Berzerkers wield two-handed weapons, the better to keep the enemy at a distance from their ward. The deadly Berzerker broadaxe is a mighty weapon capable of splitting an ogor in two, while the flamestrike poleaxe features both a cleaving blade and a fiery brazier attached to the haft by a heavy chain.\n\nThose deemed skilled enough warriors to join the Hearthguard Berzerkers are first invited to partake in ceremonial battles. Known as the Trials of Grimfyre, they involve the slaying of a gauntlet of beasts and monsters. Those who survive are allowed to pledge their oath of service, and in return are gifted their fireblessed weapon from the Runefather himself. The trials are a reflection of the challenges that await these warriors, for they must be prepared to lay down their lives unquestioningly for their lieges every time the Fyreslayers march to battle.",

As denizens of the Realm of Beasts, they understand well the role these behemoths play on the battlefield. They spend more time than any other lodge rearing Magmadroths, often all the way from birth, creating unbreakable bonds between beast and duardin.\n\nVulkyn Flameseekers seek their prizes with single-minded tenacity. They are marked out by drothscale armour that they believe will imbue them with a portion of the Magmadroths’ power. They are formidable warriors all, hardened from a harsh life in the wilderness, and they carry wicked, shovel-like ‘bokaz’ that serve as both weapons and tools of excavation.",

So fearsome are these grizzled and venerable kings that enemies have been known to flee rather than trade blows with a Runefather’s greataxe. Each one carries a mountain of responsibility upon their broad shoulders, ensuring their lodge receives a steady flow of ur-gold through which it can release the essence of their dead god. A Runefather’s rule is measured by foes they have defeated and ur gold gathered during their reign. Many of the riches and artefacts they accrue are sealed in vaults to which they alone bear the key.\n\nAs a leader that has proven themselves the most worthy Runeson of their many siblings and who has won glory a hundred times over, Runefathers are formidable warlords, their battle-lust tempered with experience. The lordly presence of a Runefather, surrounded by the bravest and most capable warriors of the lodge, inspires the warbands of the fyrd to fight even harder. Only the commands of a Runefather can halt the wild fury of Berzerkers and boost the morale of their warriors even in the most gruelling battles of attrition.",

This ruthless hunger for glory leads them to recklessly seek out the part of the battlefield where the fighting is thickest – and their eagerness for the most challenging fights often leads them to plunge into danger with a fearlessness remarkable even for Fyreslayers.\n\nSeeking to forge their own legend, many Auric Runesons will strike out alone with a band of their closest followers. On their travels they will earn great bounties of ur-gold and hunt down the most ferocious monsters to slay, often returning to their Runefather with severed heads or stripped hides to display as trophies. Each is trained from youth with the artefact weapons of their ancestors, making each a powerhouse in their own right that will only grow more devastating with age and experience. It is an honour to bear these weapons, and Runesons vie to be worthy of their legendary names.",
