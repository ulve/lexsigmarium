      "lore": "When the Idoneth Deepkin go to war, they bring their supernatural sea with them. Ethereal creatures, fish and corals flicker into existence, while features of the seabed appear all over the battlefield. A Gloomtide Shipwreck is a manifestation within this ethersea, a wreck of spectral wood that is the avatar of a myriad sunken vessels given form. This barnacle-encrusted ruin swarms with vicious deep-sea denizens, their shoals providing nearby Idoneth with cover from which to launch their attacks. Some wrecks drift into being naturally upon the ethersea’s currents. Other times, an Isharann mage might use their lilting magics to coax one into arriving with the ethereal tide.\n\nTo the Deepkin, the appearance of a Gloomtide Shipwreck during battle is seen as a sign of good fortune because of the haven it provides for attacking Idoneth. Enemies that veer too close to this eerie wreck quickly find themselves assaulted by the predatory sea creatures that use it as their lair, the marine animals recognising the floundering presence of foes as a threat to their territory. The most skilled of Isharann mages will deliberately incite carnivorous fish to harass and distract enemies, lending a measure of cover to those Idoneth nearby so they may launch pinpoint attacks with impunity.",

It can scent the merest drop of blood from many leagues away, and when hungry, it will consume almost anything it comes across. Only through magic are the Idoneth able to bind Allopexes to handlers, for the beasts’ urge to kill is irrepressible, and only trained Akhelians known as Embailors are skilled enough to steer them. The combination of Embailor and beast is highly effective in battle, and Akhelian commanders have learnt to use the Allopex’s speed and ferocity to great effect in soul-raids.\n\nFor long-range offensive capability, each Akhelian Allopex bears a harpoon launcher, effectively turning the creature into a highly manoeuvrable weapon platform. Sometimes called the ‘whispering death’ after the sound it makes, the harpoon launcher can be loaded with two kinds of ammunition, each designed to slay different types of enemy. Razorshell harpoons can be loaded and fired in quick succession and are particularly effective against monstrous targets. Retarius nets, meanwhile, are woven from Hyshian sun-siren hair so strong and fine that those entangled in them are torn apart in their struggle to free themselves.",

Most impressive of all is their ability to generate an electric charge that can stun even large targets, leaving them ripe for devouring.\n\nIshlaen Guard favour a curved sword known as a helsabre. These elegant serrated blades are light enough to allow the wielder to deliver a flurry of strikes before disengaging from combat and can harness the bioelectricity of the Fangmoras. The Ishlaen channel this force into their galv-shields, where it manifests as an energy field that turns aside enemy blows. Thanks to this protective aura, the Ishlaen are often assigned as the bodyguards of Akhelian Kings or other high-ranking Idoneth, directing their Fangmoras towards the closest advancing threats and laying them low with sweeps of their helsabres.",

When the Idoneth march to war, it is the Namarti Thralls who make up their frontline infantry. Possessing the natural grace and swiftness of aelvenkind, Thralls surge forward to meet the enemy, accepting the brunt of the fighting in order to create openings for their hard-hitting Akhelian masters to exploit.\n\nTo witness the Namarti in battle is an unsettling sight to non Idoneth. They have no eyes, possessing instead a thin veil of membranous skin across each socket. Despite this, Thralls wield their blades – known as lanmari – with dexterous skill, switching fluidly between multiple fighting styles. Indeed, in the often impenetrable darkness surrounding their oceanic homes, sight is of little use anyway, and the Namarti must learn to master other faculties in order to survive. Many of these sensory adaptations only serve to enhance their efficiency as killers on the battlefield.",

Joining in solemn ritual, they call upon the spirits of deceased Idoneth to rise and defend the living. Like phosphorescent algae, the glittering essences within the soul-reef will coalesce, taking the appearance of a mighty aelven god of the sea, with weapon in hand and a cloak of icy seawater cascading from its regal armour. Vicious aquatic life gathers around this avatar to attack any that draw near.\n\nIn the aspect of the sea, an Eidolon of Mathlann is more controlled, yet its becalmed demeanour in no way suggests it possesses a lesser degree of power. With a sweep of its deep-sea sceptre, an Eidolon in this form can release golden energies into the currents of the ethersea to rejuvenate the Idoneth’s wounded. However, the Eidolon can also turn its power to far deadlier purposes. With but a gesture, it can cause nearby foes to feel the horror of the endless sea. Suddenly, these unfortunate souls know what it is to be cast adrift with nothing beneath them but leagues of cold, dark water. This renders them paralysed in the throes of what they believe is their own death whilst the Idoneth move in to make this illusion a reality.",

Perhaps it was this gift of enlightenment that allowed Volturnos to sense Teclis’s increasing revulsion at that which he had wrought. Volturnos survived Teclis’s wrath and fled Hysh with his comrades. In doing so, he forever made himself a pariah to his former god and a hero amongst the majority of his people.\n\nVolturnos has proved himself a grand commander, uniting the fractious enclaves in the face of several grave threats. Though not all Idoneth consider him their ruler, there is no Akhelian or Isharann who does not feel a stirring wave of pride upon witnessing the High King take to battle atop Uasall, a prince amongst Deepmares. The lack of one eye does not seem to diminish Volturnos’s prowess in the least. Wielding the Astra Solus, his legendary blade, the High King cuts down any foe foolish enough to challenge him.",

Enemies fighting amidst the ethersea feel as if they are drowning on land, their movements becoming sluggish and their strikes reduced to clumsy swings. \n\nThis is hardly the extent of a Tidecaster’s powers. Such is the connection between the Isharann and the ethersea that they can constantly manipulate its currents to protect themselves from harm. Furthermore, Tidecasters act as conduits for the repressed anguish of their race, an echo of their traumatic past that can be weaponised and unleashed upon the foe to sap their will to fight. Crushing waves of despair, black whirlpools of hopelessness or raging maelstroms of horror that shatter the minds of the foe: all are powerful tools in the hands of a Tidecaster. Those stricken by such enchantments are left helpless as they choke and writhe, and those lucky few who escape quickly find themselves torn to shreds by the Tidecaster’s guardian Ethershark.",

This allows them to outmanoeuvre the enemy’s advance troops while simultaneously bleeding them. Should an opponent engage them in close combat, Reavers will draw curved daggers and fight with great skill, but whenever possible, they will stay at a distance and make use of their superior marksmanship. It might be imagined that a lack of eyes would hinder an archer, but the Namarti can sense infinitesimal changes in pressure within the ethersea and electromagnetic pulses that reveal the presence of living beings. A Reaver’s field of perception is not as far-reaching as that of eyesight, however, so they must remain within a certain distance of their targets in order to make full use of their abilities.",

However, until they return to their enclave and deposit their priceless bounty, the Soulrenders must fight tooth and nail to protect it. They do so with a vicious polearm known as a talúnhook, snaring their enemies from afar and forcing them to their knees so that they might be more easily dispatched. To aid their hunting, each Soulrender employs a Rakerdart, a bond-beast that glides at its master’s feet, ready to stab prey with its sharp bill to ensure none can escape.",

Utilising such a relic, a Soulscryer can literally gaze upon a being’s animus, judging its potency by the strength of its incandescent glow. This proves most useful on those occasions that the Isharann take to the battlefield, for a Soulscryer can always identify those souls most worthy of reaping. Soulscryers also work their strange magics to navigate the utter darkness of the deep places. Their eldritch senses allow them to guide other Idoneth along hidden paths in the realms’ oceans and rivers so that they can strike the foe from unexpected angles.\n\nThough they are not natural combatants, Soulscryers are more than capable of defending themselves. They turn their soul-knowledge and their mastery of deep-sea magic to their advantage, able to inflict chilling damage with a single, concentrated touch. Many are also accompanied by a shoal of Scryfish, creatures that vigorously attack foes with their spiked jaws.",

Vicious aquatic life gathers around this avatar to attack any that draw near. \n\nWhen an Eidolon of Mathlann is summoned in the aspect of the storm, it appears swelling like a tidal wave before crashing into the foe. Here is the power of the sea as destroyer, a manifestation of anger that has been pent up for so long that its release is unstoppable. In this form, the Eidolon’s mere presence is enough to fill nearby Idoneth with a fierce urge to bring ruin to their enemies. Its spear of repressed fury crackles with power. This phantom weapon is composed wholly of soul-energy, its blade honed by countless years of suppressed battle-lust. In its other hand, the Eidolon wields a barbed crulhook, with which it snares foes before dragging them into the deeps.",

Others find themselves cast out by their own kind, often for speaking out against the Idoneth’s soul-based caste system. Many of these pariahs become Thrallmasters – the raider-captains of the Idoneth military. Tasked with venturing out into the realms at the head of a Namarti host, they seek out fresh soul-matter for the enclaves. Thanks to their extensive voyaging, Thrallmasters become experts at reading the ocean currents. They often tattoo themselves with priceless tidal maps illegible to other Idoneth. Most greatly enjoy using this painstakingly gathered intelligence as leverage against higher-ranked Akhelians, who must grit their teeth and deal with a Thrallmaster if they are to reach the best raiding grounds.\n\nBy necessity, Thrallmasters learn to use multiple combat techniques. They can alter their stance and weapon in a moment, wielding the vaisurr bident to skewer larger foes or switching to twin helsabres to slice a bloody path through massed ranks, and they rigorously train their Namarti charges in these same fighting styles. Many make use of bonded Snapjaw Eels to defend themselves, for when these creatures sink their fangs into the foe, they are near impossible to remove.",

Holding the title of Warden of the Soul Ledgers, Lotann has marched to war alongside all of the enclaves in his time, cataloguing every spirit they harvested and each that escaped their grasp. Few understand the true purpose of Lotann’s exhausting work, though some whisper that it is his crushing duty to record every act of predation carried out by the Deepkin so that they might one day atone for their deeds. Eschewing the more physical aspects of battle as crude distraction, Lotann employs a multi-limbed, highly intelligent Ochtar familiar to protect him from foes that move in close. The Ochtar is capable of aiding him in his counting whilst keeping enemies at a safe distance with a serrated blade and spiked cudgel.",
