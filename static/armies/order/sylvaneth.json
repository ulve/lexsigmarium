      "lore": "Kurnoth Hunters are considered taciturn and strange even by other Sylvaneth. Their soulpods were planted after Alarielle’s metamorphosis into her war aspect, and what emerged was unlike anything that had come before. Masters of weapons as large as mortal men, Kurnoth Hunters are the knights of the forest, and their presence heralds a coming time of trial. Kurnoth Hunters will hunt down their prey with never-ending stamina, enduring defiantly as they strike down their foes.\n\nKurnoth Hunters are capable of detecting the subtlest arcane vibrations along the realmroots and spreading a portion of this power to their kin. Their affinity with the land also makes them excellent scouts; they often serve to secure sacred sites before the Sylvaneth’s enemies – or ostensible allies – can reach them.\n\nThose Kurnothi that wield greatswords are the immovable front lines of the Sylvaneth warglades. They charge through the enemy with bludgeoning strides and swinging blades, decapitating those that do not fall beneath their churning roots. It is their job to cut down the enemy before they can approach the sacred groves of the Sylvaneth or to hunt and punish those that have affronted the Everqueen.",

Drycha is an old and bitter spirit. She was planted in the dark years of the Age of Chaos within the shaded vale of Hamadrithil.\n\nDrycha is a twisted monster of a forest spirit, cultivated in the hour of Alarielle’s fury and despair and thrust into fighting from the moment of her birth. Thorned vines lash furiously about her towering form as attendant spites buzz with a hunger for slaughter. She sings a song of bloodshed that draws in the most blackhearted and bitter of the Sylvaneth. Drycha and her followers now slaughter not only the followers of Nurgle, but any perceived trespassers to Ghyran.\n\nDespite their grievances, Drycha and Alarielle both grudgingly recognise that they each embody crucial aspects of the natural world. Drycha is willing to fight alongside those the Everqueen deems allies, though ‘accidents’ and disappearances abound.",

However, centuries of woe have seen the song of the Dryads darken. The wailing notes of the Forest Folk – laments of loss and profound anger – leave the foe fearful and disoriented. These songs also call upon the lands that the Dryads tend so carefully, summoning thickets of tanglevines to ward off enemy blows.\n\nThough they will heed the wishes of a wargrove’s commander in the manner of the innately hierarchical Sylvaneth, Dryads are not soldiers – only killers. They are adept ambushers, slipping through dense wyldwoods to emerge where the foe least expects them. Then the Dryads begin their murderous work, talons lashing out with such fury that they can find purchase upon even the armour of Chaos.",

Such is the bond between Sylvaneth and spite that, should a retreat need to be made, the zephyrspites will detach and fly at the enemy to buy time for their master.\n\nThough the Gossamids’ bows are supple and strong, it is their arrow shafts that hold the secret to their lethality. The quiverbug each keeps at their hip extrudes a special type of larval pod, its shape akin to an arrow. When fired into the flesh of an enemy, the ravenous grubs couched within the arrowhead hatch, eat and grow to maturity in seconds, usually resulting in a shocking explosion of gore. Once their gestation is complete, a buzzing whirlwind of new quiver-bugs will fly off, seeking out more Gossamids to recommence the cycle of life-through death.",

Yet these powers can just as soon be turned to war. At Alarielle’s command, her enemies are washed away in torrents of raging waters, strangled by thrashing ironoak roots, or transmuted to living wood. There is no mercy in the Everqueen’s heart; she has entered the season of her War Aspect and now blooms with a passion only vengeance can curb.\n\nAlarielle’s sorceries are able to summon flurries of healing pollen, as well as to mature new groves of Sylvaneth. In her right hand she wields the Spear of Kurnoth, a relic said to contain the dwindled essence of her consort and huntergod. Her left limb has been replaced by the Talon of the Dwindling, a sickle-like wooden claw that drains opponents of vitality. \n\nOne of the Everqueen’s most powerful allies is her mount, a hulking Wardroth Beetle. This titan’s horns can topple even fortress walls. When Alarielle takes wing, her Wardroth is capable of transforming into a swarm of pulsing glowspites to follow her and reform once more.",

It is they who bear the sombre duty of extracting lamentiri from fallen Sylvaneth, harvesting the soulseeds with reverent swings of their sickle-staves before returning to plant them in sacred soil.\n\nPart shaman and part subordinate to the Treelords, a Branchwych’s connection to the earth grants them strange intuition that any Sylvaneth would be wise to heed. The Branchwyches, however, are just as infamous for their tempers, for they are swift to anger when pressed – and the forests often reflect their anger, fed by their furious spirit.\n\nOnly the fey spites are immune to a Branchwych’s wrath, for these druidic Sylvaneth dote upon the strange little creatures. Many wondrous varieties of spite flutter around a Branchwych, but their closest companions are the bittergrubs – caterpillar-like entities that ride upon a Branchwych’s shoulder and savagely attack nearby foes. Once a bittergrub has fed sufficiently, it will metamorphosise into an emerald cocoon before splitting open to release a wave of shimmering, rejuvenating pollen across the tainted earth.",

Yet despite their martial trappings, Tree-Revenants are not the sort to simply advance on a foe in disciplined lockstep.

Should the dragonspite echo the song in its hissing voice – and not lash out with its mandibles to tear the supplicant apart – the Sylvaneth will be permitted to clamber atop their new steed. Only then are they deemed worthy to join Alarielle’s elite.\n\nDragonspites were once natives of the World-that-Was, nestling within the bark of the Oak of Ages. Even as the world ended and that great tree was cast into the void, the dragonspites survived, trapped within mystical amber. When Alarielle sang the Rite of Life to restore the realms from corruption, this amber was sent running like wax and the dragonspites were freed, swollen through the magics they had absorbed. Alarielle’s song has become entwined with their souls, and only a single mighty blow can hope to overcome their regenerative capabilities – otherwise they will heal and endure, as endless as the seasons.",

Revenant Seekers are far less prone to flights of whimsy than their kin due to the solemnity of their duty, and the dirge-like, mourning refrains that they contribute to the spirit-song are prized only in those glades of the grimmest disposition.\n\nOn the battlefield, however, the Revenant Seekers’ moribund demeanour is replaced by a fierce determination. Fuelled by a desire to protect the legacy of their people, they will fly into the very jaws of death to this end. The rituals by which the Seekers extract the lamentiri from dead Sylvaneth fills nearby forest spirits with a portion of their kin’s final energies. This essence knits wounds back together and regrows lost limbs as a last gift from the fallen, imparted only to those who fight to ensure the continuation of their race.",

Within it resides a sliver of the hunter-god’s guiding animus, and when hurled it can wreak terrible damage before being plucked back into the Lady’s hand by a reaching vine. The Lady also bears the ultimate mark of Alarielle’s favour – her Verdian Crown, which blankets those fighting around her in her mother’s power and allows them a greater measure of arboreal control.\n\nThe liana-like whips that lash from the Lady’s body at will are thick and razoredged, thirsting for vengeance as a shadowed flower thirsts for sunlight.

They channel it through an ornate flute set with a fragment of bark from the Oak of Ages Past. They possess an instinctive sense for the ley lines that cross the realms, following these arcane pathways and playing their song of rejuvenation so that they may coax the lands to healing. On their travels, they are surrounded by swarms of flittering spites and carpets of thrashing roots which viciously lash out at any who would impede them.\n\nThe song that these Revenants play is composed of pure arcane force. To the Sylvaneth, it is a stirring tune of great vibrancy, while to their allies it is a fey and unsettling earworm that never entirely fades from the edge of hearing. Beings corrupted by Chaos perceive the ballads of a Warsong Revenant as terrifying, soul-shredding dissonances that echo weirdly from the depths of the woods; those who hear it are left staggering and insensate, right up until they are beheaded by the Revenant’s arcanely charged falchion.",

Thus do they become Treelord Ancients, the leaders of the clans, calling upon the experience of centuries – or even millennia – to chart a path forwards.\n\nAge weighs upon even these creatures, however. Some Treelord Ancients are irascible souls jaded by centuries of life and loss. Others may appear outright mad by mortal standards, either in the manner of a charismatic sage or an unpredictable natural disaster that has begun to splinter under the weight of years. In most cases, a Treelord Ancient’s eccentricities stem from them simply hearing the spirit-song on a keener level than most, allowing them to weave complex spells from the strands of life and cultivate new Wyldwoods into being in an instant. Even in battle, as they lead their kin and harness their magic in breathtaking displays of jade spellcraft, a Treelord Ancient keeps part of their mind clear and detached. In doing so, they carefully observe all around them, the better to share their knowledge with future generations.",

They embody the darkest of the natural cycles which sees them shunned even by their own kin, some of whom believe that their bitter malaise can spread. Many Spite-Revenants band together in exile and are collectively known as the Outcasts.\n\nSome say the Spite-Revenants were once spites who made grim bargains in an effort to become true Sylvaneth, or else are the product of a ritual of Alarielle’s that went hideously awry. When war calls, these twisted creatures creep forth from hidden groves, bodies glowing with eerie wisp-lights. Though their talons are sharp, the greatest weapon of the Spite-Revenants are their voices, for while they cannot harmonise with the spirit-song, they wail cacophonies of nerveshredding dissonance.",

This furious resolve is seeded within them, and bombastic aggression radiates within them like a midsummer storm. Though not blind to the intricate social hierarchies of their race, these spirits have little time for politics, and their brusque manner sees few glades eagerly receive them.

This innate skill leads to them developing a deep spiritual connection with the forests of the realms. Despite their great size, they are able to navigate strange and secret paths through the deepwoods and between sites of power, emerging seemingly from nowhere to assail a terrified enemy.",

Even after a Twistweald’s attending Swarmsage summons spiteswarms to chew away the surface growths, the roots under the skin are impossible to fully purge, leaving the hosts in constant agony. They barely hang onto their sanity day by day, redirecting their pain into each devastating cleave of their weapons.
