      "lore": "The Arkanauts are the prime naval body of the sky-ports, weather-beaten and well used to a life of hardship. They carry out all the various duties of a skyvessel’s crew whilst being blasted by roaring aether-storms that can turn a duardin’s skin as brittle as glass. Their vision must be pinpoint, unclouded by laxity or ill health, to watch every cloud for sky raiders or supernatural beasts that seek to tear their vessels apart and prey on those inside. Should enemies come, it is the Arkanauts who take the brunt of the attack, manning the gunwales and discharging volleys from their aethershot pistols to blast the foe from the skies.\n\nIt is during land battles, however, that the Arkanauts shine. When the skyvessels come in low, their target in sight, tight-knit teams of Arkanauts descend on heavy suspension cables. These duardin warriors fight hardest when retrieving rewards, eager to make their commission by increasing their shares. As they swing their cutlass-like Arkanaut cutters, their ship-mates overhead rain fire into those who would flank them. Those who wish to become Arkanauts must partake in a six-day set of trials, competing in military drills and aerial manoeuvres. The observing Captains bid for them via extensive contracts, whereupon the newcomers will undergo their rites of initiation before stepping aboard for the long haul.",

They often hitch alongside vessels by hanging onto gunwales and ports to travel between places that require their services most. They use mag-boots or grapnels to latch on to the sides of the ships and thereby conserve fuel for when their skills are most needed.\n\nThe prospects of an Endrinrigger are good, for they report directly to the fleet’s Endrinmaster or even its Admiral. Only through merit and daring can a duardin progress through Kharadron society, and the Endrinrigger’s role affords plenty of opportunity for both. One who has seen to the repair of a mangled propeller rig during a harkraken attack, not only getting it spinning at optimal efficiency once more but emerging with all their fingers into the bargain, has enough cold steel in their nerves that one day they might well make the rank of Admiral. In battle, an Endrinrigger’s aether-powered tools become lethal weapons capable of punching through armour or messily sawing off limbs. Those foolish enough to attack an Endrinrigger at work may find a drill launcher boring into their armour or a skyhook ripping them apart.",

It is by the wit and the word of each Admiral that their crew prospers or flounders – but more than that, when out in the realms’ wild skies, it is the difference between life and death.\n\nAdmirals are at the bleeding edge of the fierce meritocracy of Kharadron society. Each works their way up from the ranks of the Arkanauts to the position of Captain through sheer consistent excellence, and then they have to pass a stringent examination before the Admirals Council before taking their vaunted rank. Their knowledge is far from purely theoretical, as any who have seen them swinging their skalfhammers will attest – powered by their backpack-mounted generators, these weapons can crack a ship’s hull with ease. Should the Admiral thrive by balancing the right amount of daring with enough hard won wisdom, they will accrue more and more shares. Should they fall behind, they might find themselves having to sell off their assets and even their ships. This tends to lend each Admiral a serious gravitas; in matters of war and trade alike, they are cold as stone and unyielding as titanium.",

The vessels each have a deck protected by a reinforced balustrade. Atop the forecastle is mounted the most devastating of an Ironclad’s weapons, usually either a harpoon-like great skyhook for impaling and snagging monstrous beasts, a volley cannon for mowing down numerous foes, or a great sky cannon that can blast apart distant targets in an incendiary display of power. Batteries of swivel guns mounted at the base of the craft’s hull rake through enemies whilst grudgesettler bombs blow great craters in the hordes below.\n\nThose who risk a boarding action with an Arkanaut Ironclad are met by the most determined of counter-assaults. To the crew, their ship is more than just a soulless war machine; it is their flagship and their very home upon the open airs.",

Predominant amongst these forecastle-mounted weapons is the heavy sky cannon. These guns can be calibrated to fire the aethershot equivalent of shrapnel to shred several foes at once. Some Captains prefer to mount a heavy skyhook on their vessel to best skewer airborne beasts and retrieve the aether-gold they have consumed.",

Even when they are repainted to match their contractual employers for a long-haul contract, they are owned by the Grundstok Company alone. Exceptional escorts, they multiply the potential of every Ironclad and Frigate they fly alongside several times over. They excel as defensive point-guards, blasting away at interlopers before their employers’ craft take so much as a scratch. On the offence, they are swift and capable, flying with impressive speed to pinpoint and neutralise the enemy’s own artillery or batter monstrous denizens as soon as they have left their caves.",

Drifting off-course can lead the incautious through hidden realmgates or tears in the fabric of the realms, into the path of a metal-slashing Aethervoid Pendulum or a sudden maelstrom.

He went on to search for his lost father and brothers, all experienced sky-sailors who had disappeared after their search for the abandoned sky-port Barak-Thrund. His location of that ancient settlement and the realmgate beyond would see him make his fortune.\n\nNow, Drekki seeks to strike new seams for the Kharadron to exploit. He is a mean shot with his triple-barrelled pistol, laughing in triumph on those occasions he takes out three of his enemies in one shot. For larger prey he levels his harpoonlaunching axe, spearing vital organs before delivering the killing blow with its heavy blade.",

It is this tenet that leads him to the white-hot crucible of every fight to wrest bountiful rewards. As the richest duardin on the sky port, he ranks just below the Admirals Council, allowing Brokk to call upon a fleet of hundreds of ships and ten times that number of Kharadron in times of need. He strides through it all at the fore, clad in a warsuit packing enough firepower to fell an ogor in a blistering fusillade.\n\nGrungsson’s eye for weakness is penetrating, his natural opportunism honed to a rapier-fine point. His encyclopaedic knowledge of the Kharadron Code have seen him tie veteran Codewrights in knots of logic. In the furore of battle, Grungsson is a formidable prospect. He descends from the skies on one of the most advanced endrin-rigs yet devised. The suit’s inbuilt cannon, Grungsson’s Boast, is able to arm itself independently, and at the twitch of Brokk’s finger spits devastating salvoes as he takes his whirring aethermatic saw to the flesh of the foe. Whatever Grungsson does, he does with style. Those who have seen him slay rampant orruk Brutes with blistering shots from his moustache-mounted aetherblasters can attest to the fact that even in the heat of battle he has an undeniable panache.",

At the push of a button, gaseous chemicals, refined and toxified at need, can be belched out in an esoteric attack – so potent is this killing cloud that it can melt flesh from bone in seconds. Last of the Aether-Khemist’s tricks is the method of maximising the killing power of their comrades’ guns.

Experts at controlling their one-pilot endrins, they can wheel and charge with impressive precision even in the midst of a howling maelstrom. They are stern and disciplined figures amongst their brethren, for when the fleet is under attack by the daemons and nightmarish terrors, it is they who are responsible for getting their vessel-bound comrades to safety.\n\nTheir weapons are many. Their skypikes contain inbuilt aether pistons, allowing them to send its harpoon-like tip shooting forward with such force that it can punch through the hull of a rival ship. Just behind the blade is a dynamo-style battery that can discharge a short burst of electricity into an impaled foe. In their free hand, each Skywarden carries a vulcaniser pistol, a weapon that can fire a super-heated beam that has the power to melt steel armour. Furthermore, should an engagement not be going in their favour, they can deploy clusters of skymines to wreak havoc among a tightly packed enemy formation, providing a crucial window for them to disengage and fall back.",
