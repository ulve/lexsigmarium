      "lore": "Eltharion is an ancient hero of aelvenkind. In the final days of the World-that-Was, he was slain while doing great service to the martial god Tyrion. But his soul was strong, its remnants lingering an age in the darkness of the void. Teclis recalled his friend’s sacrifice and was determined to save him. He recreated the warrior’s legendary Fangsword and armour before creating a doppelgänger to house Eltharion’s soul, yet this form burnt to ash upon coming into contact with that most luminous essence. However, Teclis’s grief turned to wonder as he watched the empty armour pulse with an inner glow, stirring and lifting a blade in salute. Eltharion walked once more, now a being of purest light bound into his enchanted plate.\n\nEltharion serves as the champion of the twin gods. He is a masterful duellist, striking and feinting in close combat as fluidly as the wind itself. Perhaps most crucially, his nature as a being of insubstantial light makes him almost impossible to destroy and allows him to venture into places so suffused with magic that they are lethal to mortalkind.",

The stones represent the Lumineth’s tendency towards duality – the twin gods Teclis and Tyrion, the sun and the moon, and the martial and magic creeds that dictate the Lumineth war-castes are just a few examples of this. To conjure these crystals in perfect equilibrium, distributing energy evenly between them, is considered to be one of the purest embodiments of this harmonious concept. It also demonstrates a deep bond between the aelven mage and their native realm. Many Scinari strive to learn this spell as soon as they are able, for it is just as much proof of their own enlightenment as it is a vital weapon of war.",

Even those foes who keep their distance are not safe, for in extremis, Avalenor can summon great blasts of stony debris and crushing earth to hurl across entire battlefields.\n\nAvalenor’s wisdom is beyond measure, and no few Lumineth princes and sages owe their rise to his blessings. Yet Avalenor has suffered greatly over the centuries. During the war against Nagash, the Great Necromancer performed a ritual of demise upon Avalenor’s mountain-form, sending his war-construct flaking to nothing. Eventually, Avalenor returned, striding out of the mists and into the fray once more in an apparent miracle. But while Lumineth society rejoices, those closest to Avalenor grow more concerned, as he is prone to mutter in elder tongues or stare off vacantly into the horizon. Some whisper that scars of Nagash may still linger upon his soul.",

To petition one to march to battle, the Lumineth must spend weeks appealing to these entities, for the mountains loathe rash decision-making. Once their course is set, however, these aelementors are unbreakable allies. Their wisdom is always sage, and their hammers can cave in the skull of a gargant with a single swing. In their presence, the power of the earth itself is awakened, unleashed through devastating shock waves.\n\nThe war-forms of mountain spirits are themselves miniature ecosystems, their bodies garlanded by trees and their sunmetal armour cooled in the mountains’ own lakes and streams. Lesser animuses shelter in their mighty shadow. Their core, however, is their mask, which resembles the visage of an Ymetrican longhorn. Should the unthinkable happen and this mask be lost, then some part of the mountain’s soul may be lost with it. Still, Hysh’s peaks know that they must risk this grim fate to defend their earthly incarnations.",

These leaders employ effectively limitless military authority, able to veto invasions or legitimise the mustering of hundreds of warriors. The Lord Regents do not occupy any formal seat of power in a Great Nation’s rulership; they serve instead as Tyrion’s proxies, commanding those fronts where the Lord Phoenix cannot.\n\nRegardless of the nation they were born in, Lord Regents follow the Decree Tyrionic, moulded by traditions that prize decisive action over drawn-out cerebral contemplation. Each Regent spends countless hours studying matters of strategy, allowing them to make quick calls during battle, and they are adept at channelling solar energies into their warriors’ sunmetal blades until they blaze with captured light. The trials by which a Regent earns their rank are taxing in the extreme. Tracking down and earn the allegiance of a lightcourser, a swift-footed quadruped energised by Hysh’s radiance, is but one of these. As their mount sprints forward at blistering speed to deliver bone-breaking kicks, the Lord Regent draws upon the aetherquartz crystals worked into their wargear to launch precise attacks.",

The focal point of a Sanctum of Amyntok is the rune Yngra, symbolising both rescue and imprisonment – a fitting icon, given that its summoner is surrounded by a barrier of light energy. Protected thus, arrows and magical bolts dissipate harmlessly upon contact with the sanctum. The rune hovering above shines with pure Hyshian magic, limiting visibility by blinding those who target the mage beneath it.\n\nThe beams that compose this portable sanctum are drawn from the outer reaches of Haixiah, the magic-saturated rim territory of Hysh, allowing it to burn away even the most vicious of incantations. However, such is the sanctum’s strength that a mage is ill-advised to summon it when surrounded by allies. The Sanctum of Amyntok is often deployed by aelven casters in their most desperate hour, when they are exposed to enemy fire with no reinforcements to help them.",

As one would expect from a son of Ymetrica, Lyrior appears in public as a warrior with a soul of stone, riding resplendent upon Farael, his lightcourser steed, and wielding his armies with the same intractable purpose as he does his enchanted lance Daemonbane. Yet in private, this mask begins to slip, and the Lord Regent Supreme’s grief wells to the surface.\n\nIn the early decades of the Age of Sigmar, Lyrior was commanded to lead the defence of Tor Limina. Yet in doing so, he was forced to leave his home city woefully vulnerable. Lyrior was to pay the price for his loyalty; upon returning, he found the city obliterated by greenskin raiders. When Uthralle discovered the brutalised remains of his beloved kin, something broke within him. Even now he screams into the void each night; only the spiritual ministrations of a trio of Cathallars keep his soul intact. Lyrior now funnels his torment into deeds, riding out to command almost every battle Ymetrica wages against the orruks in person and venting his hatred.",

When Teclis truly focuses his will, even the greatest wizards cannot thwart him. Though relatively frail of body, Teclis’s magisterial arts can unravel all but the strongest arcana, and his trove of relics – from his elegant but potent blade to scrolls marked with symbols of his lost homeland – further supplement his deific might.\n\nTeclis is accompanied by a winged, leonine form lambent with innate power. This is Celennar, the spirit of Hysh’s true moon. During the darkest days of the Ocari Dara, when the Realm of Light was overrun by Slaanesh’s armies, Teclis ventured into the void to beseech Celennar’s aid. Long did the moon-spirit remain aloof, yet Teclis persevered. Some believe that the debate between the pair continued without rest for an entire month. To this day, when not leading the Lumineth warhosts, the Mage God and the lunasphinx deepen their bond through fervent discussions of philosophy and moral tenets.",

Yet in the Age of Chaos, Sevireth was lured into a series of volcanic caverns by Slaaneshi cultists and sealed within, left to rage trapped and impotent. When the Lumineth at last freed him, the wind spirit was filled with a terrifying ire, his pride leading him on a rampage.\n\nThankfully, Sevireth’s anger appears to be mostly directed against Hysh’s enemies. When the Lord of the Seventh Wind deigns to take to the field, he brings with him the flaying force of the sandstorm, capable of eroding cities and camps to nothing in hours. Even other winds fear to dare too close to Sevireth, and the trail of scoured bone he leaves in his wake tells that his fury is far from sated.",

As little more than children, they passed the sense-warping Trial of the Mindrazor. As they grew to adolescence, Ellania proved able to face down the most learned opponents in symposium debates, while Ellathor triumphed in back-to-back Vanari duelling contests. Teclis soon saw in these siblings echoes of him and his own brother. What this might portend, even the Archmage does not know, but Teclis is not one to discount the symmetry of fate. After much deliberation and testing, the twin gods dubbed them Eclipsian Warsages, champions who would travel far and fight to enact the will of their gods while seeking to temper their natural ability with wisdom.\n\nTo aid them, both twins received potent gifts. Ellania was bequeathed the staff Dianaer, whose realmstone head is said to capture the light of pure potential, as well as her faithful avian companion Atheane. Ellathor was granted the aetherquartz sword Altairi from Tyrion’s own arsenal. The twins now travel across the realms carrying out missions for the aelven gods. In battle, whichever sibling is more adept at quelling the enemy takes the lead, allowing them to excel regardless of whether magic or blade is required most.",

The Lumineth know how best to harness the free-floating metaliths that dot the Mortal Realms. Not for the Lumineth are the crude methods of humanity, who attach chains to the islands and drag them along. Instead, aelven mages will commune with the metalith upon which the Shrine Luminor sits, sharing their desires and emotions with the stone spirit within. In this way, the metaliths are capable of receiving commands to hover alongside marching armies, the sanctified energies of the shrine purifying the path ahead.",

Only decades of repentance soothed the mountains’ jaded souls and, in time, compelled them to grant the most worthy aelves wisdom and strength.\n\nTo become a Stoneguard demands a singular will. Many are the tests an aspirant must endure, from fasting atop the highest peaks to running alongside roaring rockfalls. The climax of these trials is to be literally buried alive. If the aelf is judged to have heeded the mountains’ wisdom, they will find themselves able to breathe through tiny cracks in the rock and eventually rise as an Alarith.\n\nWhen the Stoneguard plant their feet and focus upon the teachings of their aelementor, the flesh of these warriors takes on the consistency of stone. Then the Alarith truly do become immovable objects, shrugging off even the most determined of blows. Hammers wrought from sedimentary rock and diamondcored mattocks are their favoured weapons.",

The moment the foe reaches them, the aelves thrust their pikes forward, splitting bodies open before wrenching their weapons free and lunging for the second enemy wave. Each aelf innately trusts those at their side, and when working in harmonious synchronicity, they can blunt the advance of all but the most terrible foes.\n\nThe term Auralan translates to ‘luminous host’. It refers to those Lumineth infantrymen entrusted with weapons of sunmetal, a precious, magically conductive material that has been tempered in the burning light of Hysh until the realm’s brilliance becomes locked within it. The tips of the Wardens’ pikes are fashioned from this substance, allowing them to channel power from their aetherquartz brooches into said weapons. This energises their polearms and grants them the ability to melt enemy armour like wax.",

Emblazoned upon them are the mandala-runes of the aelven gods and aelementiri temples, emboldening the spirits of all nearby and allowing Lumineth souls greater clarity when strategising and defending.\n\nWith all this in mind, to let such a banner fall would be an unforgivable offence. Should their banner be marred by the muck of a battlefield, there is only one recourse for the disgraced aelf: they must undertake a pilgrimage to the edge of Hysh, seeking redemption within its searing light. To this day, no such penitents have returned.",

To send an arrow soaring into the sky, its tip glimmering with purest light before descending to deliver judgement upon the unworthy, speaks to the souls of the aelves – as does the ability to strike down foes before being sullied by their presence. It is the task of the Auralan Sentinels to ensure that grinding melee rarely becomes a necessity, and they train fastidiously to squeeze every iota of potential from their bows and arrows.\n\nOf course, being aelves, the Sentinels have sought to improve upon the classical design of the bow as far as possible. Their efforts have resulted in the triple‑stringed arcbow, a weapon whose unique capacity for curvature and pull grants it two different modes of function: arrows can either be sent arcing skyward over distances that seem unbelievable to less enlightened mortals or else fired in a straight shot and with enough force to pin several warriors together. Sentinels forge their arrow tips from precious sunmetal to better ensure each shot flies true and pierces its mark.",

These souls trekked to the highest peaks, dodging death while singing laments of contrition. They formed works of beautiful art from interlocking stones and refused to succumb to anger or fear even as their vengeful surroundings sought to claim their lives. Something in this unshakeable purpose slowly placated the mountain spirits, and they granted the regretful aelves moss growths and scuttling creatures to feast on.\n\nOver time, these tenuous relationships became true understandings, and those Lumineth of a most mystical disposition were granted the secrets of geokinetic and lithomantic sorceries. Stonemages speak with the commanding rumble of the avalanche and can adjust gravity’s pull to send even heavy stones floating serenely into the air around them. In battle, such is the bond between Stonemage and aelementor that, when the mountain spirits march in their war-forms, these aelves are often found in close proximity, channelling their powers into their patron to grant them even greater fortitude.",

Though a breeze may feel soft and playful, it can turn bitter in a moment; a Windmage may artfully manipulate it to carry arrows with lethal precision or to force air into a foe’s lungs until they burst. The wind carries shouted orders from different portions of a battlefield or else sees them drowned out, bringing dissolution and anarchy to a battleline. Many Windmages are seen as unpredictable tricksters by fellow aelves, but this is more a statement of wary respect than condemnation, for to decry the wind’s amusements will quickly see one swept into its lethal embrace.",

Where these searing runes emerge, the aetheric power of light surges; nearby Lumineth are empowered, while rifts torn open to the Realm of Chaos may be sealed.\n\nThe Calligrave discipline was pioneered by Il’yentai of Syar. It was she who devised the means of binding arcane energy into parchment for later deployment, and it was she who developed the tools of their trade: mystical brushes and daethar stilt-shoes that prevent stored spells from being accidentally earthed through contact with the realms. Successive generations then built upon her efforts, refining their sigil-conjuring techniques to the level of true artistry. When summoning an arcane construct, a Calligrave ensures that the incantation will not fail, having studied its runes thoroughly and extensively.",

Even the undead can be afflicted by this magically augmented negativity; with their foes immobilised by a sudden self-awareness as to their cursed half-existence, a Lumineth host is able to cut them down without resistance.\n\nCathallars are lonesome figures who move as if in a detached trance. They keep their hands and feet bare at all times, allowing the negative psyche-magic that clings to them to dissipate into the earth. Cathallars rarely seek out the company of others, and fellow aelves are generally content with this – though they respect the burden these mages carry, few wish to confront their own darker aspects.",

It is not unusual for a Scinari mage to live a life of solitude in order to better concentrate on their own mental and magical advancement. All too often, however, it is the shorter-lived races that require a more pointed education. It is the task of the Scinari Enlightener to show the arcane might of the Lumineth, teaching enemies their place with blistering displays of magical ability that turn the symmetry and symbolism of Hysh into a devastating weapon.\n\nAn Enlightener usually seeks subtle means to turn the battle to their favour. Granting allies shields of magic, channelling energising spells through runes to share them with their compatriots or causing assailants to suffer a precise reflection of any harm they deal out are just some such magical weavings. Yet in the heart of every Enlightener is a hidden desire to manifest the full wrath of Hysh, and very occasionally, when they are within the blazing crucible of battle, they will do just that. At such times, they bring a fatal form of enlightenment to bear on the enemy, letting loose multiple spells at once to sear foes to ash.",

Rather than joining a warhost, they will fight alongside their kin when circumstances align. On more than one occasion, their timely arrival just as battlelines meet has meant the difference between victory and defeat, as the travelling spell-swords reveal arcane troves or sources of natural magic below the battlefield.\n\nYet as an eclipse briefly hides the light, the Loreseekers also have their darker aspects. They are often charged with obscuring as much as illuminating, sequestering away relics or knowledge that the Lumineth judge too dangerous for any besides themselves to possess. Should these items have already fallen into the grasp of others – including supposed allies – then a Loreseeker may turn to thieving or assassination in order to end the danger before it can manifest, though this is strictly a last resort. In the struggle to restore the realms, no sacrifice is too great.",

They are able to slip around defences or through the narrowest gaps with unearthly precision, before suddenly accelerating to embed themselves in the vulnerable throats and eye sockets of stunned enemies. Even in close quarters, the Windchargers perform their deadly art, for their arrows have far less distance to travel and far less force to waste.\n\nTo keep pace with the wind is no easy feat, and so the Windchargers seek the allegiance of treerunners, Hyshian beasts that revel in chasing the aetheric breeze. Such is their grace that they can dart through the upper boughs of the realm’s forests as if gravity holds no sway over them. When working as one, an aelf and treerunner can pass through even the most fearsome melees as a graceful blur, the rider loosing volley after volley in lethal close quarters before their mount darts away.",

In battle, the Bladelords serve with quiet, unflinching pride, driving the enemy back with perfectly placed strikes that allow the Scinari to practise their arcane rites undisturbed. When surrounded by unending ranks of foes, they can change style effortlessly to instead land a flurry of blows that can slice through hordes with ease.\n\nIn turn, the Scinari seek to further uplift the minds of their guardians. Bladelords are encouraged to see battle as a complex equation, where momentum, force and reaction must all be balanced in a split second. Successful calculation of these competing forces sees the Bladelords wield their lightweight greatswords and twin blades to lop off limbs and heads in whirling strikes, each clumsy blow from their adversaries accounted for and countered with the perfect riposte.

Dawnriders adhere to schools of mounted combat that emphasise the swift slice, riding in close formation so the power of their sunmetal lances is concentrated into a single scouring impact. Tales abound of Dawnriders trampling through hordes that outnumber them ten times over, the burning light magic that surrounds their charge scorching enemies to cinders.\n\nThese cavalrymen forge incredibly close bonds with their steeds. The stallions ridden by the Dawnriders are thoroughbreds from the wide plains of Xintil, independent creatures possessed of greater intellect than their equine peers. They are not broken in conventionally; instead, they choose to stand alongside aelves they deem worthy, which ensures that both aelf and steed possess a keen instinct for the other’s intentions. They navigate together, the stallion charging fiercely into the fray while its Dawnrider wields lance and blade to clear the path forward.",

Concealed within the heads of these bolts are reservoirs of aetherquartz-infused water that, when agitated by a sudden ceasing of momentum, spark in a blinding flash, serving to debilitate an enemy regiment at a critical moment. Should the artillerists want the Starshard Ballista to target enemies even further afield, they make use of bonded scryhawks, elegant avian denizens of Hysh’s mountains. These birds work in unison with their masters to signal the position of the foe.",
