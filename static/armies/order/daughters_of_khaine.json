      "lore": "Slaughter Queens are the martial leaders of the war covens, chosen for their skilled bladework and their fanaticism for dealing death. For a Slaughter Queen, the battlefield is her temple, and the jetting blood of an opened throat is her sacred offering to almighty Khaine. They fight with a sword in each hand, weaving a pattern of red ruination. The Blade of Khaine – blessed with the furore of war – strikes with blurring speed, while the Deathsword is imbued with Morathi’s scorn, its enchanted edge slicing gaping clefts in flesh and armour with even the slightest stroke. A Slaughter Queen wears little in the way of armour, instead relying upon feints, deft dodges and flawless acrobatics to avoid enemy blows.\n\nNo Khainite can help but be inspired by the unrestrained butchery enacted by a Slaughter Queen. Where these priestesses roam, the land is soon watered with the blood of the freshly slain. Though they prefer bladework to ministry, Slaughter Queens are still adept at channelling the hot rage of Khaine into devastating battle prayers. All learn the killing words of power – appellations of Khaine that, when shouted at the correct pitch, can smite an enemy or even blunt an incoming spell.",

These enchanted blades are summoned from Morathi’s own cauldron for the use of these spellcasters and are possessed of a hateful sentience. They are manifestations coalesced from steaming blood, and contain the life-essence of the countless slain foes that bubbles within the Máthcoir. The desecrated brew bubbles with bloodlust and hatred that, once imbued in the swords of the Bladewind, drive them to slice through armour with unnatural ease to get to the flesh and blood beneath.\n\nThese falchions are sharp enough to pierce even the thickest of iron shields. The blades carve through rock and masonry equally as effortlessly, preying on those who would seek shelter behind them and bisecting enemy after enemy until their summoner deigns to dismiss them.",

In this guise, she goes by the name Morathi- Khaine, purporting to be the second coming of the god of war and murder. Skilled in both slaughter and magic, she is not averse to more direct methods of attack – her ability to inspire a zealous frenzy in her followers is as lethal a weapon as her ensorcelled spear, the infamous Heartrender.\n\nAlthough she wields his Iron Heart, Morathi carries none of Khaine’s divine essence in her own veins. If her Khainite masses were to discover her duplicity, they would surely seek the destruction of their usurper goddess. Yet such is Morathi’s skill at manipulation, coupled with her ruthlessness in silencing dissenters, that only those with a death wish would dare challenge her openly.",

      "lore": "Slaughter Queens are the martial leaders of the war covens, chosen for their skilled bladework and their fanaticism for dealing death. For a Slaughter Queen, the battlefield is her temple, and the jetting blood of an opened throat is her sacred offering to almighty Khaine. They fight with a sword in each hand, weaving a pattern of red ruination.\n\nFor a battle worthy of their finest ritual offerings, the war covens of the Daughters of Khaine bring forth the greatest of their religion’s icons – the Cauldrons of Blood. Mounted on iron-shod wheels, these arcane devices surge forward, propelled solely by the incantations of their riders, as if the machine itself was lured onwards by the promise of carnage. Each is connected to Morathi’s own cauldron, which drains a portion of each sacrifice poured inside. Slaughter Queens who have spilt rivers of blood in the name of their goddess are granted the honour of riding one to battle, and their aggressive strategy sees them wield it more like a close-combat war machine. Brought to life by blood rituals, the iron statue of Khaine upon the shrine roars its anger in torrents of molten metal blood or swings its massive sword to hack down those who dare close with the cauldron.",

It is the Hag Queens who are responsible for concocting the potion that drives their fellow Khainites into a rapturous battle-rage.\n\nKnown as witchbrew, this sacred concoction is derived from the blood of Slaughter Queens slain in the service of Khaine. Resonant with the fierce exultation that the deceased experienced in their final moments, this holy liquid is refined and blended through a sorcerous process known only to the High Priestesses. The resulting broth has the viscous consistency of clotting blood, and a single draught heightens the senses to supernatural levels, imbuing the drinker with an uncontrollable bloodlust and robbing them of any sense of self preservation. Khainites under the influence of witchbrew will ignore even the most horrific wounds as they carve their foes apart. Hag Queens, of course, do not simply observe their workings from afar; when their sacred duties have been performed, they join the killing as mercilessly as any of their kin.",

Its razor sharp edge slices  easily through flesh, while some bear a notch that causes profuse bleeding when twisted. Armour is generally considered an impediment to the art of slaughter, though Witch Aelves do wear enchanted bracers and pauldrons that can turn aside the rare blow that they fail to evade.\n\nAs their battleline devolves from an ordered march into a whirlwind of stabbing and slicing, the Witch Aelves truly lose all self-control. Still beating hearts are ripped from victims’ chests and flesh is daubed with gore-red runes. There are  many dark tales of Witch Aelves losing themselves utterly to the slaughter and turning their sacrificial knives upon supposed allies.",

Each Blood Sister is equipped with a heartshard glaive – a heavy polearm ideal for driving through armour and ribs to impale an enemy’s heart. Their kragath war-masks are crafted to recall the god of murder’s own terrible visage. Each kragath is also layered with illusory enchantments that allow the wearer to take the form of a normal aelf, should the occasion require it.\n\nBlood Sisters can channel the blackness of their tainted souls into a strike known as the scáth touch. The lightest contact from such a blow can transform the victim into an unmoving crystal statue that is still horrifically conscious. The brood nests of the Melusai are lined with these living monuments. As sensualists, the Blood Sisters consider an eternity of sensory deprivation the worst of all possible fates, hence their delight in inflicting it upon others. For a Blood Sister, the ultimate cruelty is to thrust her glaive quickly enough to slice out a foe’s beating heart while transmuting them to still-living crystal.",

Invoked by incantation and sacrifice, the blazing manifestation known as a Heart of Fury has appeared in the skies above many a Khainite war coven, stirring all who look upon it into a delirious frenzy that allows them to shrug off the gravest injuries. The enemies of Hagg Nar have learnt to dread this omen, for it heralds terrible bloodshed. As the heat of battle swells to a burning frenzy, the most devout of Khaine’s priestesses can draw upon Morathi-Khaine’s own power. When these gore-streaked zealots scream a prayer that is as much a war cry as a call of worship, a manifestation of the Heart of Fury crystallises in the firmament in a crimson miasma.\n\nThis blood-dripping icon burns with supernatural rage. It is held aloft by an iron glove above the battlefield, bathing all those below in its wrathful aura. Those Daughters of Khaine so empowered by its light are sent into a frenzy of murder, continuing to fight and kill even when stricken with mortal wounds.",

Any who meet a Medusa’s gaze find their body exsanguinated in a welter of gore. Neither does the sorceress shy away from combat; wielding the razor-sharp gauntlet known as a whisperclaw in concert with a Bloodwrack spear, the Medusa can cut a swathe through any foes foolish enough to approach her.\n\nThose selected for the Slith-onóir might be the rising champions of their sect, but some are chosen because they are openly contentious when it comes to Morathi- Khaine’s strictures or her claims of a divine mandate. Regardless, after the ritual, Bloodwrack Medusae become the goddess’s most faithful and loyal servants. Naturally resonant with arcane power, they eagerly absorb every scrap of magical knowledge that she grants them, including all manner of malicious spells and curses.",

The first their prey knows of the danger is when barbed missiles begin to rain down upon them.\n\nThe leader of a Blood Stalker pack is known as a Krone.

They spin, leap and pose dramatically as they use whips and blades to slaughter their foes.\n\nThe Sisters of Slaughter are considered extremist even by other Khainites. Whether absorbed by revenge or overcome with the murderous spirit of Khaine, the warriors take the vow of druharú and don masks of living metal. In an excruciating rite involving boiling blood and spells of bonding, those who would join the sisterhood permanently graft the helms onto their heads, the metal leering ever more cruelly as it scents blood.\n \nBarbed whips known as kruiplash are the weapon of choice for the Sisters of Slaughter, and some also wield a bladed buckler that can turn enemy strikes and deliver a lethal counter-blow of its own. When the barbed whips are used in battle, the serpentine coils snap out to sever limbs, lacerate eyes or puncture armour to flay the flesh beneath.",

Up close, Doomfire Warlocks are gaunt and pallid, their black eyes full of spite. Emblazoned upon their brows are hateful runes that cause them great pain but are also vital in keeping them alive.\n\nThere are few male aelves in the cities of the Daughters of Khaine – fewer still within the war covens. This is by nefarious design. Only the weakest souls retrieved from Slaanesh are used to create male aelves, and all are worked hard, fed poorly and drained of blood in daily rituals. Doomfire Warlocks are at least given a measure of false autonomy, allowing them to ride to battle and wield dark arcane power. However, their dhaimkhyr – the sacred rune that grants Warlocks their magic – keeps them bound to Morathi’s will, and she will also use this connection to siphon off portions of their soul to keep them withered and subservient.",

Each is connected to Morathi’s own cauldron, which drains a portion of each sacrifice poured inside.\n\nWhen a Hag Queen accompanies the altar, she brings the blood within the iron vat to a furious boil until it gives off billowing clouds of crimson steam. This offers strange protections, and Khainites nearby find themselves able to shrug off wounds or dodge blows more easily. Those fortunate enough to be offered a draught of the cauldron’s brew find themselves plunged into an ecstasy of violence, their martial prowess magnified by the Lord of Murder.\n\nBrought to life by blood rituals, the iron statue of Khaine upon the shrine roars its anger in torrents of molten metal blood or swings its massive sword to hack down those who dare close with the cauldron.",

It is from this toxic slurry that the Bloodwrack Viper emerges. This enormous serpent is formed from boiling blood and contains a sliver of Morathi’s arcane might, and it is animated by a deeply rooted shard of her malice.\n\nThe Bloodwrack Viper is a magical manifestation of hatred and bitterness. With but a whispered word from its summoner, it will go on a ferocious rampage, killing all in its path. It binds its prey in a crushing embrace, burning mortal skin away with the heat of its ichorous body before squeezing so forcefully that the victim explodes in a shower of gore. Should an enemy be too large to simply splatter open, the serpent curls around them and tightens its coils, holding its prey in place and choking them in torrents of sticky black blood. With its victim immobilised, it will then strike with its monstrous fangs.",

Able to leap from shadow to shadow and weave tools of murder from darkness, no quarry is safe.\n\nShadowstalkers can transport themselves across vast distances by slipping through the Umbral Web, an intricate pattern of shadowy realmgates that connect the Eight Realms. Some forge pacts with shadow daemons, so thoroughly mingling their blood with these monsters that, if cut, they bleed pure darkness. Using foul sorceries, they can even command a victim’s shadow into murderous animation.\n\nThough their talents are unrivalled, all Shadowstalkers are condemned to a terrible fate: the Umbral Web gradually erodes their soul until they transform into a living shadow. Morathi conceals this horrifying truth from those upon whom she bestows the mircath. Often, these unfortunates are those whom the goddess has marked out as potential dissidents. As Shadowstalkers, they can at least serve her well before they meet their end.",

The Heartrenders do not stop to watch the gory aftermath of their arrival. Always do they seek new prey, their powerful wings carrying them to another part of the battlefield in moments, javelins materialising out of the mists into their hands. Should a tempting enough target present itself, the Heartrenders will forego their missile assault and dive straight into combat – their spiked shortspears are perfectly weighted for hand-to-hand fighting, and they can swiftly retreat should the enemy bring overpowering numbers.\n\nHeartrenders conceal their faces behind gilded masks, never revealing their true appearance even to their fellow Khainites. Some say that their faces are horrifically deformed and avian, possessing none of the statuesque beauty that the aelves prize. Perhaps this might account for their bloodthirsty nature and the cruel delight with which they pursue and slaughter retreating foes.",

Somewhat less frenzied in their ferocity than their Heartrender kin, Lifetakers possess an uncanny ability to read the battlefield.

Neither does this servant of Morathi shy away from combat; wielding the razor-sharp gauntlet known as a whisperclaw in concert with a Bloodwrack spear, the Medusa can cut a swathe through any foes foolish enough to approach her.\n\nSome Bloodwrack Medusae are borne into battle atop mobile shrines. Propelled by unseen magics, the bladed Bloodwrack Shrine grinds forward to crash into the enemy battleline. Two shrineguards armed with long goadstaves strike out, while the writhing Medusa uses her weapons and deadly gaze to join the slaughter. As formidable as the shrine is in close combat, it has another, more sinister purpose. A strange mirror known as a scáthmre stands at the shrine’s centre, reflecting not just the Bloodwrack Medusa’s deadly gaze but also an agonising aura, a shadowy projection of the scathing hatred harboured by the monstrous serpentine creature. Such is the power of this dark emanation that it causes nearby foes to perish in the throes of unbearable torment.",

Upon the advent of Morathi’s ascension, a shard of Morai-Heg’s divinity escaped from the Dark Prince’s gullet to pierce through Krethusa’s very soul, causing ink-black feathers to erupt from her back. Though she is a serious threat to Morathi’s power, the goddess has found herself forced to keep her alive; Krethusa has the trust of Sigmar’s people, to say nothing of a growing retinue of loyal followers who now view Morathi with doubt and suspicion.\n\nBy plucking a feather from her dark wings, Krethusa calls upon Morai-Heg’s power to decimate her foes. Each sanctified pinion can summon a flesh-eating murder of crows to tear apart any enemy foolish enough to defy her.",

The Avatars of Khaine will stride out from their ceremonial cauldrons to fight alongside their worshippers, swinging falchions as tall as ogors. Even those foes that stay wisely out of reach are not safe: each statue can shoot great gouts of blood from its mouth so hot that they can melt flesh from bone.\n\nThe Avatars of Khaine play a pivotal role in the religion of the murder-cults as conduits of bloody prayer. Any priestess that stands near one finds their connection to Morathi-Khaine strengthened and their chants calling down dark miracles of sizzling ichor. Since Morathi ascended to godhood and claimed to be Khaine reincarnated, some avatars have been recast closer to her image. Not every priestess agrees with such a change – though to give voice to these treasonous thoughts would invite a swift and gory death.",

They spin, leap and pose dramatically as they use whips and blades to slaughter their foes.\n\nThe Sisters of Slaughter are considered extremist even by other Khainites. Whether absorbed by revenge or overcome with the murderous spirit of Khaine, the warriors take the vow of druharú and don masks of living metal. In an excruciating rite involving boiling blood and spells of bonding, those who would join the sisterhood permanently graft the helms onto their heads, the metal leering ever more cruelly as it scents blood.\n\nBarbed whips known as kruiplash are the weapon of choice for the Sisters of Slaughter, and some Sisters battle with a short stabbing blade in addition to their lash. When the barbed whips are used in battle, the serpentine coils snap out to sever limbs, lacerate eyes or puncture armour to flay the flesh beneath.",

However, it is only in battle where they can truly immerse themselves in the holy rapture that bonds their souls with the Murder God.\n\nWitch Aelves fight with long sacrificial knives known as sciansá – steel blades each tempered in blood and blessed by a Hag Queen. Its razor sharp edge slices easily through flesh, while some bear a notch that causes profuse bleeding when twisted. Armour is generally considered an impediment to the art of slaughter, though some Witch Aelves favour a light, bladed buckler that can deflect a heavy swordblow – then lash back out to slit the throat of the enemy with a fatal riposte\n\nAs their battleline devolves from an ordered march into a whirlwind of stabbing and slicing, the Witch Aelves truly lose all self-control. Still beating hearts are ripped from victims’ chests and flesh is daubed with gore-red runes. There are many dark tales of Witch Aelves losing themselves utterly to the slaughter and turning their sacrificial knives upon supposed allies.",

When Morathi ascended to godhood, she was cleaved in two by a vengeful soul she was consuming for power. Her form was split into the regal sorceress Morathi-Khaine and the monstrous Shadow Queen. This serpentine war form is framed by enormous bat-like wings and a mane of venomous snakes. She can pulverise stone walls with her lashing coils, whilst those who meet her dreadful gaze find their blood erupting from their veins. The Shadow Queen wields an oversized version of her legendary weapon, Heartrender, that befits her formidable stature.\n\nMorathi-Khaine and the Shadow Queen are one being joined by a single soul. Together they form a terrifying union of martial and arcane might capable of obliterating entire armies. Nevertheless, the goddess faces a constant battle to balance the clashing aspects of her psyche. In times of great strife, the appeal of the Shadow Queen’s straightforward, murderous hatred becomes very difficult to deny, and the composed power of Morathi-Khaine wavers. The ragged wound in Morathi’s godly soul may never truly heal, and she wonders if the final cost of her ascension is yet to be revealed.",
