      "lore": "The specialist wizards known as Alchemite Warforgers can exaggerate the innate strength of metal exponentially. These members of the Gold College are often requested by the Freeguilds for their mastery over metals and arcane machinery, which proves to be more practical than the high arcane arts of other wizards. Through their magic, the resilience of the metal used by the God-King’s armies is multiplied many times over. Wrought iron becomes hard as duardin-worked gromril and shields become inviolable bulwarks. Meanwhile, enemies find their own armour transmuting into cumbersome lead, staggering them at the critical moment. Blade hilts suddenly burn white-hot, forcing their owners to drop them, whilst halberds find their biting edge drizzling away into molten slurry.\n\nThe signature artefact of the Alchemite Warforger’s profession is the massive crucible they bear at their side, a portable forge that contains the power of an inferno. Thick layers of leather protect them from the heat, but even veteran Alchemites must use long-handled tongs to bring out the runic cubes within. They use these cubes as lodestones that affect magical motes and the flow of the aether – simply by turning them this way and that, the Alchemite can melt metal around them until it flows at their command.",

These are true masters of the killer’s art, able to shroud themselves in gloom so as not to be seen by the naked eye. They believe there is a noble purity in taking a single life to save the lives of many – no matter the method required.\n\nActing as scouts and skirmishers in times of battle, Assassins far prefer to act as independents. If a sorcerous black mark in the shape of a curved blade appears on a person’s flesh, that unfortunate soul has been marked for death. To take flight is futile, and attempts to resist merely prolong the inevitable. There is no fortress, city or fortified war camp that the feared Shadowblade Assassins cannot infiltrate, and few foes can hope to survive the potent deathshead poison delivered by their wicked daggers. Stalking the shadows, the Assassin only reveals their position when they launch a killing strike. Once their target is in their sights, the Assassin seemingly bursts from pure darkness to unleash a flurry of attacks upon their unsuspecting victim.",

They riddle their targets with iron‑tipped bolts, each one viciously barbed to ensure that it cannot be removed without tearing apart the victim’s flesh in the process. The use of these painful projectiles speaks to the sadism of these shadowed warriors. The Darkshards often indulge in unnecessarily cruel behaviour in battle, such as intentionally trying to hamstring lesser foes and even shooting perilously close to human allies to create fear for their own enjoyment. Though they are confident in the knowledge that they will not hit their comrades, on account of the Darkshards’ almost supernatural accuracy, this fact is little known by the average Steelhelm.",

Amongst the Collegiate Arcane’s members are quick-tempered pyromancers from the Bright College and druid-like mages from the Jade College with the power of life at their fingertips. Morbid devotees from the Amethyst traditions of Shyish wield the chill magic of the grave, while those of the Gold College specialise in transmutation.\n\nThe wizard-philosophers of the White College use brilliant devices set with aetherquartz when they need to bolster the illuminations and ritual exorcisms they use to banish the foe. Known as Luminarks of Hysh, these obsessively calibrated contraptions concentrate motes of Hyshian magic through a series of arcane lenses. In doing so, they form a beam of light so intense that it can melt right through a rampaging daemon lord and leave a smoking hole behind. Powerful White Battlemages direct searing rays of light from the Luminark to vaporise enemy champions whilst deftly casting scouring sorceries of their own.",

Another volley sounds, then another – as many as three salvoes in the space of a minute. Against the daemon and the gheist, the Fusiliers will fire shots inscribed with sigils of the God-King. Magic-wielding champions are silenced with a sphere of pure realmstone, taken with silver tongs from a small nullstone casket. In this way, even the meanest human gunline can take down the most vicious scourges of the Mortal Realms.\n\nThe weapons of these gunlines are loaded and fired in much the same way as a miniature cannon. Each is also set with a thick wooden shield, which, when facing outwards alongside the iron-rimmed shields of footsoldiers, creates a defensive Castelite formation. The slaughter-fusils used by some Fusil-Sergeants, however, are more complex. These devastating firearms are triple-barrelled and able to be fired in quick succession or in one blistering volley. Such weapons are cumbersome, especially when carried in conjunction with hardwood pavises and lanterns for reloading in darkness; yet, in a flurry of movement, the gun is prepped, propped and raised. Its signature roar is never far behind.",

Whether through lineage traced to an ancient magocracy, natural affinity or the fruits of long study, each Battlemage has passed trials beyond number. They can slay a foe with a shouted phrase and a killing gesture just as easily as they can provide salvation with a warding symbol or chant. Amongst the Collegiate Arcane’s members are quick-tempered pyromancers from the Bright College and druid-like mages from the Jade College with the power of life at their fingertips. Morbid devotees from the Amethyst traditions of Shyish wield the chill magic of the grave, while those of the Gold College specialise in transmutation.\n\nThe bearded shamans of the Amber College prefer to commune with the wilds rather than learn in formal settings. They specialise in the animalistic magic of Ghur, allowing them to empower their fellows with monstrous strength. The most capable amongst them ride to war upon giant, twin-headed griffons they have spirit-bound to their will. Only a wizard can hope to control these especially feral beasts, as more than one Steelhelm has found to their cost. From the backs of these terrifying beasts, an Amber Battlemage can lay waste to foes from afar or strike from on high in a vicious frenzy of stabbing beaks and ripping talons.",

Runelords are talented metalsmiths who have mastered the ancient art of rune-shaping. Through rituals of hammercraft, they can unbind hostile magic or imbue the weapons of their kin with fearsome killing power.\n\nEach Runelord carries a rune staff and a forgehammer. First, they will beat sigils of power into metal and rock surfaces with the forgehammer, drawing on practised knowledge passed down through generations. Then, each rune is imbued with magical power using the rune staff, allowing the aetheric energy to be stored indefinitely. By calling on the stored, latent power of their engravings, the Runelords can imbue the weapons of their kin with ancient might. They will also craft warding runes during battle, allowing them to dampen or unbind the castings of enemy mages.",

      "lore": "The armies of the Freeguilds eschew static towers in favour of those built atop hulking Ogor Warhulks. These battlements provide mobile vantage points, allowing a gunner riding aloft to snipe the command personnel of the enemy with relative ease. Their long-barrelled fusil allows them to engage at range and the tall crow’s nest protects them from return fire. When the enemy closes in, the ogor below uses their giant tower shield and heavy-headed mace to crush those foolish enough to get within reach. Those caught on the rim of the shield soon feel themselves being hoisted upwards and the ogor’s trowel-like teeth sinking into their flesh, for even a city ogor, relatively civilised in comparison to their wilderness-dwelling kin, likes a snack in the middle of battle.\n\nThe relationship between soldier and ogor is not an easy one. Even city ogors, known for their ability to overrule the grumbling of their stomachs for hours at a time, are unpredictable. No ogor likes being clambered over by a mere thinling who should really be inside their gut. Those teams that last tend to have some manner of connection – a life debt after the gunner had saved the ogor from certain death, for instance, or a lost bet that the ogor feels obligated to fulfil.",

The metal from which these weapons are forged is said to be the hardest in the Mortal Realms; only the duardin know how to craft it – and they guard this secret jealously. Expertly wielded by the Hammerers, these two-handed greathammers can split rock like cordwood and crack enemy skulls as easily as Aetherwing eggs, allowing the duardin to smash a path through even the most tenacious foes. When the Hammerers’ carnyx sounds the charge and the gleam of their gilded, sloped helmets can be seen cresting the horizon, surrounding allies are inspired to fight ever harder. The duardin are particularly beloved of the Warden King whom they serve; even away from the battlefield, they are his trusted advisors and drinking companions.",

They target the rear of enemy forces that seek to close upon those they call allies – or, more often, bait. An echelon of Drakespawn Knights hunts armies like the rokodiles of Ghur stalk their prey, snapping and weakening before moving in for the kill. The contribution of the Order Serpentis to the Cities of Sigmar is significant; many an expedition would have failed without the charge of a Dreadlord’s host. Whether they fight for Sigmar’s cause, or purely for their own advancement and sadistic enjoyment, is another matter entirely.\n\nThe Drakespawn Knights follow the ancient beastmaster traditions of Narkath – an Ulguan empire lost to the Age of Chaos that waged war from the backs of Black Dragons. The Drakespawn were created in an attempt to recreate the Nakarth mounts of old, but they lack the raw power and flight of their draconic predecessors. The aelves believe that, on some level, the Drakespawn must know that they are incomplete creatures, for they are bitter-natured indeed. Only when these carnivorous monsters can rip and tear in protracted combat do they show any signs of joy, savouring every hunk of meat they bite away and guzzle down.",

Yet some claim it has a darker source, for there has been at least one occasion on which an assassin’s bolt has passed right through the Matriarch. Stranger still, the eldest of the cities say that Zenestra was a great-grandmother when Sigmar’s Tempest broke, though that cannot possibly be true.\n\nDespite these rumours, any who have seen Zenestra in battle know that she has the God-King’s protection. Her palanquin is so redolent with Azyrite energy that lightning crackles around it in a widening corona. Zenestra’s attendants never last too long in her service; each new pair is aged unto infirmity by even a month at the yoke.

Each bears a fierce totem fashioned after a great beast that reflects their fighting style. Next is a Great Herald, who holds aloft the regimental banner that will be planted at the heart of a new settlement. It is their role to sound the advance, charge and timely retreat.\n\nMost Command Corps include a War Surgeon skilled in the arts of triage and amputation. They are incredibly proficient, able to perform medical miracles even under fire on the battlefield. Should a soldier succumb to their injuries, however, their soul is guided to their afterlife by the Soul Shepherds, allowing them to escape the clutches of Nagash. The strange piping of the Shepherds’ homunculi is silent to the living, but a lilting requiem can be heard as one approaches death.\n\nLurking in the shadows are the Whisperblades, who keep the Marshal apprised of dissent. They wear cloaks of Ulguan falsecloth that allow them to blend with darkness – all the better to listen, learn and assassinate.",

They include blessed blades of banishment, heavy warhammers that echo the holy form of Ghal Maraz, lances hung with glorious banners and duardin-crafted plate armour. Some take to battle upon a proud, avian griffon to better lead by example and to survey the battlefield from on high; such a sight is a morale boost unto itself, symbolising Azyr in all its glory. Identifying where their presence is most required, they descend like a speeding comet to lay waste to their enemies.",

Each commands a Black Ark, a floating sea-fortress the size of a castle that forms the heart of their fleet. The waters of the Mortal Realms are thick with hazards, from flesh-eating seaweed to spine-flinging gyresharks that can bite a vessel clean in half. Rather than fight a thankless war against these beasts, the masters of the Scourge fleets learn to avoid or even harness them using a combination of enchantment, patience and aelven artifice.\n\nThe Fleetmasters are known not only for the speed of their assaults but also for their flair. As happy to inveigle themselves into high society as they are to stoop to the gutter, they cut quite a dash in their frill-collared drakeskin cloaks. Any would-be rivals who underestimate them are soon corrected by force; the dexterity with which Fleetmasters wield the blade is quite incredible. Though nominally a part of the God-King’s great alliance, all such lords crave power unto themselves. Many a Fleetmaster sitting upon the Grand Conclave of a fortress-city has friends in low places, a commanding interest in the local narcotics market or a lucrative sideline in smuggling prohibited goods.",

Theirs is a long, relentless battle that grinds on for hours, if not days; for such red work, the sword or the axe is their weapon of choice. In a tight wedge of muscle, horseflesh and metal, they drive their charge home, blades biting deep and steel-shod hooves lashing out to cave in faces and shatter skulls. The enemy howls in disarray as the Cavaliers burst through their formation – then wheel, weapons raised, for the fight to begin in earnest.",

These aelves are also absolutely loyal to their Sorceress, surging ahead of her on the battlefield to obliterate the foe at a single, wordless gesture. Their fanatical loyalty burns with a passion so intense that it appears unnatural, and rumours swirl as to the amount of free will they really possess.\n\nWielding their gleaming swords with supernatural grace, the Bleakswords slice their foes to ribbons with a cruel laugh and a flurry of quick strikes. Their duelling speed is as deadly as it is famed – stories circulating around Dawnbringer campfires claim they make their moves in the blink of an eye. The Lordlings leading the Bleakswords are often the fastest and most precise of their number, able to thrust their sabre so quickly that they can slit a human’s throat before the foe can even draw their blade from its scabbard. The scant few hits they fail to deflect with their shields are swiftly riposted, knocking back enemies and leaving them vulnerable to the perfect killing counter-strike.",

      "lore": "The Steelhelms are the weatherbeaten infantry at the heart of each Freeguild regiment. They cross the battlefield in a defensive shieldwall known as a Castelite formation and are often used as guardians of artillery emplacements. Throughout all levels of the Dawnbringer Crusades, there is a quiet respect for their sheer tenacity. After all, Steelhelms are most frequently the humble men and women of the Sigmarite cities, recruited from all walks of life. This is not to say that they are untrained – once they take the Coin, the recruits are given arms and armour and drilled in their city’s military academy for the expedition to come.\n\nEach battalion is headed by a Steelhelm Herald, bearer of the consecrated regimental standard. The toughest, most resolute member of the soldiery is usually given this duty – so vaunted is this honour that they would rather die than let the standard fall. Alongside them comes the Battle Priest. Ever ready to deliver a sermon or beat back the God-King’s foes with their fists and hammers, they carry the relic of a Sigmarite martyr to clear Chaos taint from their path. If a Battle Priest forms the spiritual armour of the Steelhelms, it is the Sergeant-at-Arms who provides its iron fist. Resolute, stubborn and formidable, they use wits as well as brawn to ensure they and their unit live to fight another day.",

Breech-loaded, the cannon is a hive of activity when battle is joined, its winch arm swinging to and fro as each new cannonball or shell clunks into place and its elevation adjusted by lever-and-cogtooth to optimise range and impact. No few of these munitions are inscribed with litanies to banish the gheist and the daemon. Those cannons likely to face a massed attack are loaded with loose cylinders of grapeshot that come apart on firing to send a roaring, shredding storm of firepower into the enemy.\n\nWhen the cannons are wheeled into place, they are stabilised by stout harnesses of leather and iron that pin them down into the earth. Hinged shields are unfolded to bracket the cannon’s chassis – if all else fails, it can be used as a battering ram. When several of these cannons are placed together, wing-shields abutted and crews working in coordination, the storm of firepower they can lay down is enough to fell a stampede of megafauna or a charging wave of orruks with each ear-splitting, tooth-rattling volley.",

No aelven offensive is launched in the service of Sigmar’s hosts without there being a substantial gain for these shadowy mistresses. They command absolute power over their covens in times of battle, for their Dreadspear phalanxes and Bleakswords obey them unquestioningly. The warriors’ grace is marked by a wordless focus – the only indication that their loyalty is more ensorcelled than genuine.\n\nDespots who rule with unquestioned authority and cruel cunning, Sorceresses wield dark and terrible spells that can blast the life from their foes or wrack them with unimaginable agony. They will slit the throats of their own thralls in an instant if the need arises, allowing them to draw power from the sacrifice. They see engaging in melee as beneath them and thus take satisfaction in speaking words of pain that contort any who dare draw too close.",

They take pride in never giving in, lamenting the flightiness of beardlings today and the substandard quality of grot warriors compared to the battles of yore.\n\nLongbeards have a reputation for being able to hold a tunnel or corridor network against any foe, and they will fight in pitch darkness if the situation demands it. They carry to battle the hallowed steel of their forebears, hefty weapons wrought with the expert craftsmanship of ancient smiths. With gromril shields tilted forth and ancestral weapons raised, even formidably strong enemy armies will surely break upon their lines. Such a sight is so reassuring to the younger Dispossessed duardin that many find their spirits galvanised simply by fighting alongside these weatherbeaten warriors – and should the young ones falter in battle, one disgruntled look from their shield-seniors is enough to have them back on their feet in a hurry.",

They are masters of bullet and bomb, destroying foes with flashing volleys of noise and smoke. They are as unrelenting and stubborn as the rest of their duardin kin, planting themselves in position before unleashing wave after wave of artillery fire at a single word from their Ironwarden commander.\n\nSome amongst the Irondrake ranks make use of grudgehammer torpedoes that can fell even a fully grown troggoth as their kin fire away at the mass of the enemy battleline. With such terrifying heavy weaponry, Irondrakes are particularly adept at tunnel fighting, marching forth without cover to blast enemies from shadowed caves, relying only upon master-crafted gromril armour for protection. Should any foes get in close, this diamond-hard defence fends off any attempts to retaliate – and the heavy plating over their fists allows them to knock down would-be assailants with a hefty punch.",

She is most beloved of the common folk, who are fiercely loyal to her on and off the battlefield.\n\nIn battle, Vedra wields enchanted weapons taken from conspirators she has personally slain. First in her favour is the blade Parchtongue, white-hot with Aqshian magic that is cool to her touch alone, followed by the greataxe Justice. When fighting alongside the Cults Unberogen, she opts for the Hammer of Zeal. She hates the heavy mace named Warmaker with a passion and has ‘accidentally’ lost it a dozen times, though it somehow always finds its way back to her.\n\nVedra’s famous battle-temper is mirrored in her great leonine steed, the manticore Infernadine. Only those with formidable willpower and authority could ever hope to train a manticore; Vedra possesses both qualities in abundance, and the two make a terrifying pair indeed.",

Whether through lineage traced to an ancient magocracy, natural affinity or the fruits of long study, each Battlemage has passed trials beyond number. They can slay a foe with a shouted phrase and a killing gesture just as easily as they can provide salvation with a warding symbol or chant. Amongst the Collegiate Arcane’s members are quick-tempered pyromancers from the Bright College and druid-like mages from the Jade College with the power of life at their fingertips. Morbid devotees from the Amethyst traditions of Shyish wield the chill magic of the grave, while those of the Gold College specialise in transmutation.\n\nThere are those of the Collegiate Arcane who rely on esoteric technology over the savage dominion seen in Aqshy and Ghur. Battlemages of the Celestial tradition have a great insight into reading the stars of the aetheric vault to pick out strands and echoes of future events. They make frequent use of portable astrolabes and telescopes to bolster their powers. Some will ride to battle upon Celestial Hurricanums, massive chariot-like constructions whose orreries can summon a vortex of aetheric energy from the skies. They use this energy to blast the foe apart with bright, scouring lightning.",

Fleeing targets are run down by the Dark Riders, who stop only long enough to secure their kills before riding hard back to their masters. For those marked by the Dark Riders, there is nowhere to flee. The red-eyed shadowmares ridden by these cloaked killers are unnaturally silent on the approach in spite of their speed, allowing their masters to level spears and repeater crossbows to deal a fatal blow to their quarry.\n\nOn occasion, Dark Riders fight alongside the military forces of a city’s expedition. They terrorise enemy encampments and patrols, striking forth from unknown quarters in a succession of lightning-fast raids. Dark Riders wage a war of terror and confusion, attacking their enemy’s weakest points with merciless precision. They slaughter at will then melt back into the shadows before their foes have a chance to react.",

His stoicism and agility is impressive, his skill with spell-banishing pistol and runic broadsword all the more so. With silver stakes and bullets engraved with nullstone maxims, Galen is an expert in destroying the incorporeal. From spellcasters and shamans to daemons and spectres, his weapons are anathema to magic and can dispel arcane energy in a flash.\n\nHis weapons, of course, would be useless without the skill of the man behind them. Galen’s careworn face belies decades of experience destroying Sigmar’s foes. He is a decisive and tenacious hunter, capable of ignoring even grievous wounds when a hunt needs concluding. Having faced some of the darkest creatures of the Mortal Realms, there is very little that he is afraid of, and when threatened, Galen will always protect his daughter first. Having mentored her and enabled her to flourish into the steel-hearted sharpshooter she has become, he remains her devoted guardian above all else.",

Her unscrupulous talents nearly saw her executed, but Toll saw the crypt-breaker’s potential and recruited her, assuring her that if she served Sigmar faithfully, her previous crimes would be forgotten. Second of the agents is Mistress Verentia, who lurks like a spider at the centre of a web of intrigue. Her agents observe every corner of the Twin-Tailed City. Her ‘little watchers’ are not humans but urban beasts: crows, rats and cats that communicate their discoveries to their mistress via her enchanted glove. Finally comes Lord-Castellant Valius, who is responsible for Hammerhal’s internal security. He is the Keeper Aqshian and bears the Clavis Magna – a device that allows him to pass through any threshold in the city and emerge from any other.",

Dreadspears attack with pinpoint certainty, each warrior having been trained to wait for the perfect moment before thrusting their weapons into the hearts of their foes.\n\nThose Dawnbringers who have seen the Dreadspears in combat have remarked on the almost mechanical unison of their movements, how they march forth fearlessly into situations so dire that other warriors might have fled rather than face them. Indeed, Dreadspears are often sent to take the most dangerous of sites or to recover relics desired by their Sorceress. Precious few know the truth – that behind each Dreadspear’s glazed eyes is an arcanely imbued loyalty that compels them to carry out their Sorceress’s will at any cost. It is up to these silent warriors to fulfil those tasks their mistress does not trust humans to perform, for only in mind-controlled servants can she ensure absolute fealty.",

Even their wildest stories hold true, for an Ironbreaker’s word is itself nigh unbreakable. Nevertheless, few believe them – though perhaps this is for the best, given all that they have lived through.\n\nEach Ironbreaker marches to battle with a diamond-hard warhammer and gromril shield. Their commanders are known as Ironbeards, who take potshots at oncoming foes from behind the Ironbreakers’ shieldwall with smoking drakefire pistols.",

Amongst the Collegiate Arcane’s members are quick-tempered pyromancers from the Bright College and druid-like mages from the Jade College with the power of life at their fingertips. Morbid devotees from the Amethyst traditions of Shyish wield the chill magic of the grave, while those of the Gold College specialise in transmutation.\n\nEach Battlemage carries a trove of strange paraphernalia, from carved daggers and smoking grimoires to scrying orbs that seem to contain the stars themselves. Many are quite eccentric after spending years in isolation honing their craft. This, combined with their potential to unleash scouring elemental attacks that can wipe out entire battlelines, means they are viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion by the more earthly troops. Even Marshals can find themselves annoyed by a Battlemage’s quirks – though the best leaders know well to make the most of their accompanying wizards, consulting them on all matters magical.",

It is their responsibility to preserve the legacy of their kind, to ensure that though the erosion of time and adversity may have snuffed out the flames of their ancient holds, they keep the proud traditions of their people alive.\n\nEvery Warden King knows the names of those who wronged their forebears. As they march out to defend or reclaim their holds, they intend to settle those grudges.

Every Cavalier-Marshal is well drilled in leading the charge, collapsing enemy battlelines in a single, decisive attack. Often carrying the weight of a Dawnbringer Crusade upon their shoulders, they are inspiring champions all.",

Armand Callis and Hanniver Toll are agents of the Order of Azyr, mortal veterans of the shadow war between order and anarchy that is fought daily in the streets, noble districts and grand halls of the God-King’s mighty cities.\n\nFew members of the Order of Azyr have served Sigmar so long and so faithfully as Hanniver Toll. Countless heathen sorcerers, depraved cultists and other enemies of civilisation have met their end by his hand, dispatched with a pistol blast or a killing stroke from his arming sword. Entire cities unknowingly owe their continued existence to his intervention. Travelling alongside him is Armand Callis, who supplements his mentor Toll’s world-wise experience with rugged determination and heavy firepower. Impressed by Callis’s quick wit and fighting ability, Toll recruited him on behalf of the Order. While Toll navigates the murderous underbelly of the sprawling capital of Hammerhal, Callis stands at his side, ready to draw his brace of duardin-crafted pistols in the blink of an eye.",

These creatures are terrible to behold, more like the sinuous and shadowy drakes of Ulguan legend than the proud Draconith of Ghur. To see one of these monsters looming out of the stinking fug of war is often enough to break a foe that was expecting to fight only soft-skinned humans. When these beasts exhale clouds of noxious gas that poison those foolish enough to confront them, their twisted, wrinkled lips pull back in snarls of sinister glee. Like sabrecats playing with defenceless bear cubs, they claw and swipe at their reeling victims before catching them up and finishing the job in a spectacular display of gory dismemberment.\n\nThe Dreadlords who ride these drakes were the nobles of Narkath, an ancient Ulguan nation felled during the Age of Chaos. They are the ones who smuggled the last Black Dragon eggs out of that cataclysm and who retained the knowledge of how to hatch them through blood sacrifice. The relationship between Dreadlord and Black Dragon is not one of master and beast; it is a symbiosis between two ice-hearted killers who share the same insatiable lust for slaughter.",

No aelven offensive is launched in the service of Sigmar’s hosts without there being a substantial gain for these shadowy mistresses.

The warriors’ grace is marked by a wordless focus – the only indication that their loyalty is more ensorcelled than genuine.\n\nMany Sorceresses go to war upon fearsome Black Dragons. They delight in the terror in the eyes of their enemies as the scaled beasts rip their prey apart with sword-sized talons. Meanwhile, from the drake’s elegant fanged maw, clouds of caustic, choking gas billow over the battlefield from on high to poison all below.",

As Steam Tanks can be quite temperamental, with every inch of their massive surface concealing cogs and machinery, the crews of such behemoths maintain them even during battle with meticulous rituals and checks.\n\nAt the forefront of larger Steam Tank formations ride the Steam Tank Commanders, veterans of countless battles who are deft at coordinating shock assaults that leave the enemy shattered and reeling. Though these finely dressed warriors may be mistaken for nobility, often bedecked in feathers and fabrics in the colours of their parent city, they should not be underestimated. Each earned their rank by surviving expeditions and wars that led to the establishment of strongpoints across their home realm. After one too many disdainful comments referring to them as soot-covered engineers, they reimagined themselves as steel-shod knights of legend, commanding respect wherever they go.",

Though no sound-minded Marshal would openly admit it, there are few better ways to scour the realms of the taint of Chaos than through blood sacrifice, few better ways to honour the authority of the Heldenhammer than to suffer in his name – and suffer these wild-haired mendicants do.\n\nWhen the enemy is close at hand, crowds of Flagellants will hurl themselves into the fray with a screamed prayer on their lips. They claw down as many of the enemy as they can in an act of superlatively violent martyrdom.

Hordes can be broken with sprays of widespread fire, or the clattergun can be concentrated on more hulking single targets – such as ogors and orruks – to blow them off their feet. Most lethal of all, however, are the aircraft’s grudgebuster bombs. This grimly fond nickname has been given to the explosives by their creators, for should the duardin have had any grudges against those enemies hit by their obliterating blast, they will surely be resolved when only ash and bone is left behind. Some crews will even go as far as to carve the names of specific warlords or foes they wish to see dead into the bombs, hoping their ancestors will guide their strikes towards successful vengeance.",

These can act as excellent scouting assets and messengers at need, especially in mountainous cities such as Tempest’s Eye. Small and nimble single‑duardin fighter craft, Gyrocopters roar over the heads of their targets in tight formation, strafing them with fire or scalding steam before wheeling away to begin another attack run. Their resilient metal shells deflect all but the most destructive of return fire, allowing them to circle directly above their foes and rain down devastation from above.\n\nThese war machines truly shine at range. Each one is equipped with a gun best suited for the battle ahead: either a flamethrowing brimstone gun to melt through armour as easily as butter or a boiling-hot steam gun to cook through enemy rank and file. Each Gyrocopter also carries a single payload of guild bombs. These blackpowder explosives are fantastically powerful, their detonations visible even from the horizon. Being able to operate all these weapons whilst piloting such a device is considered an honoured craft amongst the duardin, and many families pass down the skills needed to do so through their ancestral line.",

Powerful White Battlemages direct searing beams of light from the Luminark to vaporise enemy champions whilst deftly casting scouring sorceries of their own.\n\nDawnbringer Crusades in the Realm of Light always have at least one Luminark. The machines hold back tides of gibbering ghouls that make their homes in the mountains and can burn away even incorporeal daemons, making even a single machine vital to the survivability of a newly established strongpoint.",

As Steam Tanks can be quite temperamental, with every inch of their massive surface concealing cogs and machinery, the crews of such behemoths maintain them even during battle with meticulous rituals and checks.\n\nThough their drivers are often human, Steam Tanks will travel close to the duardin Cogsmiths of the Ironweld Arsenal, a guild that specialises in the wielding of blackpowder and the creation of war engines. Any expedition worth its cost in Aqua Ghyranis knows that where there are machines, there are malfunctions – and a skilled duardin engineer can repair a defective war machine in a matter of hours. Steam Tank crews try to get in the good graces of such engineers, knowing that to do so will pay dividends if their vehicles are damaged in battle.",

A War Hydra’s reptilian maws are even capable of breathing gouts of flesh‑melting flame.\n\nWorse still for their intended prey, it is almost impossible to slay a Hydra. Their draconic blood boiling with strange, sorcerous power, the creatures regenerate wounds at a terrifying rate. Those fortunate enough to count the beastmasters of the Order Serpentis as allies speak of War Hydras regrowing entire severed heads from the bleeding stumps of their necks in battle. It is said that the only way to truly destroy a War Hydra is to burn every last scrap of its flesh and drop of its blood – otherwise it will simply reconstitute itself, hungrier and more ferocious than ever.",
