      "lore": "Crypt Haunter Courtiers are respected and, in many cases, feared by lower-ranking ghouls, for as the marshals of their kingdom’s knightly orders, they possess a brutal prowess. Twisted creatures of bulging muscles and protruding bone, they have been utterly transformed by necromantic energies and are now barely recognisable as the debased humans they once were. That same necrotic power also grants Crypt Haunters formidable regenerative abilities, allowing them to shrug off all but the most devastating blows.\n\nIn battle, these warlike courtiers stampede to the front alongside other swollen ghoul-things, forming a terrifying wedge of ferocity that barrels right into the thickest concentration of enemy soldiers. Consumed by bloodlust and a need to distinguish themselves in their liege’s eyes, a Crypt Haunter Courtier seeks to outdo their kin with displays of blood-spraying savagery. They smash away with a gigantic bone club or simply rely upon their dagger-length talons to rend flesh and metal alike. As crimson ichor sprays from foes savaged by the Courtier, more ‘knights’ flock to their side, recognising that where these champions fight, the greatest feasts are found.",

In truth, of course, they are nothing more than blood-starved maniacs who launch endless wars against mortalkind in the deluded belief that they are fighting some holy war.

Yet there are elite formations in which a serf may earn a place through worthy deeds alone. The Cryptguard numbers amongst these. They are the guardians of a monarch’s estates and, more vitally, the lifewards of a court’s elite, marked by a rabid tenacity in the face of danger. Advancing to the thump of human-hide drums beneath pennants of flayed flesh, they form a sallow-faced bulwark against the enemy, showing devotion to protecting their masters beyond that of any common serf.\n\nEager to reward loyal service, their lieges afford the Cryptguard various privileges, including leftovers from their personal abattoirs and slightly more comfortable caves to serve as barracks. The most profound reward, however, is a chance for these ghouls to earn a weapon from their monarch’s private armoury. That these blades are often blunt is a deceptive weakness; they have spent years marinating in not only toxic corpse-juices but also the aetheric madness of the abhorrants. To suffer even a shallow wound can plunge even a perfectly rational warrior into the throes of insanity.",

Only the strongest wielders of necromantic power can command these undead drakes, and without their will, the beasts are swiftly rendered inert once more.\n\nThe darkness that animates a Zombie Dragon is never more evident than when it expels its breath, spewing it forth as a coiling cloud of withering death magic. This killing miasma shrivels flesh and corrodes the soul, instantly sapping the life from living beings. Husks are left in its wake where once there were soldiers. These desiccated statues are soon torn to pieces by the rampaging Zombie Dragon, while those fortunate enough to avoid its hellish exhalation flee in abject terror.",

Their jaws have strength enough to crush plate armour or tear out the throat of a rhinox in one powerful yank.

Only righteous battle can entice a Varghulf to quit their abode. Surrounded by swaying and howling ghouls, they are festooned by the Cardinals with garlands of slick sinew and organs before taking to the field. There, they enter a rabid frenzy that is terrible to behold, rampaging through the enemy ranks at will.

Though often found maintaining lines of communication between the cannibal nations and other strongholds of undeath, these chosen ghouls are loyal only to the Carrion King. Their fellows perceive the Heralds as dashing and selfless orators, bedecked in gifts from allied nations as they seek out and rouse oppressed peasants to join Ushoran’s kingdom. Yet the Herald’s message is one of pure madness.\n\nWhere a mortal diplomat might carry a scroll within an elegant sealed case, the Marrowscroll Heralds instead bear bones ripped from Ushoran’s throne, relics suffused with insanity. When these are cracked and the ensorcelled marrow within unfurled like strips of vellum, arcane derangement bursts forth, crushing minds beneath the force of the Carrion King’s delusion. To resist requires a stern soul indeed, but to reject Ushoran’s benevolence incites the Heralds and their ghoulish throngs to a frothing rage. Having eviscerated any apostates with their osseous scythe, the Herald and their new disciples press on to bring the Carrion King’s message of love to pastures new.",

As deranged as their dread master, Abhorrant Ghoul Kings see themselves as honourable lords in service to a benevolent liege, and they feel a patrician’s imperative to ensure that their loyal populace is well fed and happy. In reality, this means that they launch constant raids against the lands of the living, gorging themselves on fresh blood and meat while spreading madness and horror wherever they go.\n\nPossessing a vampire’s physical might and innate mastery over the magic of death, Abhorrant Ghoul Kings are able to animate and control the remains of long-dead titans. Greatly prized is the mighty cadaver of a great drake, for in death, the draconic beasts of the realms maintain a morbid majesty befitting a monarch. Almost immune to conventional attacks, the Zombie Dragon carries its master into the thick of the slaughter, raking with teeth and claws and belching gouts of pestilential fumes that cause flesh to bubble and run like hot wax.",

It was the carcasses of these beasts that were raised through necromancy and bound to the will of the abhorrant monarchs as Royal Terrorgheists. Filled with a vampiric thirst equal to that of their masters, they soar over the throng of combat, their otherworldly senses seeking foes to slay. Their teeth and claws are the length of Sigmarite greatswords and are capable of cleaving through armour with ease, but these monstrous creatures possess an even more fearsome weapon in their arsenal: their infamous killing shriek.\n\nThe beast’s scream is as unmistakable as it is devastating. The high-pitched wail cuts across the battlefield, shattering the minds of nearby foes. Those not slain outright are reduced to gibbering wrecks, howling as blood runs freely from their ears and eyes, soon to be devoured by the bat-like monstrosity.",

From its very creation, a Charnel Throne exudes an aura of death. This is only heightened through constant proximity to its abhorrant owner, whose madness and delusion seeps into the bones of the seat and transforms it into a pulsing nexus of insanity.\n\nAbhorrant lords often demand that their thralls drag their Charnel Throne into a commanding position on the battlefield, so that the vampire might oversee their surroundings from a regal vantage point before entering the slaughter personally. Sat atop such a mighty shrine to their own glory, the abhorrant cannot help but be convinced of their own grandeur – and it is this confidence that makes them even more dangerous. If they are forced to descend from their seat and enter the fray, an abhorrant ruler might select a steward from amongst their most trusted companions to sit the throne in their absence. This honour is only ever a temporary one, and those who abuse it are gruesomely punished for their hubris.",

Gorewardens are natural predators, able to sniff out vulnerability at a glance before descending to rip their prey into shreds. Before long, whatever remains of the enemy retreats back over the border in disarray, leaving their wounded to be dragged to the Gorewarden’s lair and devoured.\n\nGorewardens are drawn from the most loyal members of a sovereign’s extended family. They are rewarded for their faithful service not only through blood rites that see them sprout powerful wings but also by being granted the ‘keys to the kingdom’, rusted relics plundered from overrun castles that they regard as symbols of authority. Gorewardens are prone to fanaticism; after all, Ushoran himself entrusted them with their sacred duties, and to fail him would be a terrible crime. Many wear the bones of slain enemies as ruffs imitating a sunburst, marking themselves as holy warriors of the Summerking.",

These creatures are capable of unleashing a sonic cry so terrible that it can cause a mortal warrior’s heart to explode within their chest. Even should the Ghoul King be dismounted and his loyal steed slain, the enemy must still beware: inside a Terrorgheist’s foulsmelling innards lurks a swarm of corpse-bats, ready to burst free of their foetid cage and feast upon those close at hand.",

These vampires are tied by blood to their beloved Ushoran, and both his power and his madness flow thickly in their veins. As deranged as their dread master, Abhorrant Ghoul Kings see themselves as honourable lords in service to a benevolent liege, and they feel a patrician’s imperative to ensure that their loyal populace is well fed and happy. In reality, this means that they launch constant raids against the lands of the living, gorging themselves on fresh blood and meat while spreading madness and horror wherever they go.\n\nLike the noblest martial monarchs, many Ghoul Kings choose to fight at the vanguard of their army. Delusions of chivalric glory swirl in their fevered minds as they seek out and challenge the mightiest foes to single combat. Needless to say, there is little that is honourable about the resulting bloodshed. Pouncing upon their prey with terrifying speed, the Ghoul King will proceed to eat the luckless victim alive, ripping and tearing with filth-encrusted talons as their fangs sink deep into their prey’s flesh, drawing up great draughts of warm, vitalising ichor.",

Those who supped this wine were imbued with a portion of their king’s majesty and could stay the hand of death with a mere command. Abhorrants who invoke the name of the Carrion King can summon a simulacrum of this famed chalice to the battlefield.\n\nWhen manifested, the Chalice of Ushoran appears as a colossal construction of polished bone. This oversized cup is filled not with wine but with the blood and viscera of those butchered on the battlefield. The screaming spirits of the slain bear the chalice aloft, and with every fresh kill, the gore rises higher inside the receptacle until it overflows and drenches nearby Flesh-eaters. Bathed in this necromantic harvest, wounds close and severed limbs regrow, and even those mordants who have been cut down may rise to fight once more.",

Alongside these daring undead swarm all manner of hangers-on, including trackers drawn from the local peasantry, minor nobles wearing trophies seized during past hunts, and hunched ghouls grown brutish after consuming the flesh of slain beasts. Most dreadful of all are the macabre Offal Hounds – ghouls overwhelmed by bestial magic until they devolve into slavering abominations somewhere between a hunting hound, cave bat and monstrous simian.\n\nA lust for glory motivates even the lowliest squire of a Beastflayer party, yet all instinctively know their purpose: to prise open their prey’s defences through frenzied aggression, allowing their Flaymaster to strike a glorious coup de grâce. Following the keen scent of their Offal Hounds, these whooping hunters track their quarry across the chaos of the battlefield, surrounding them and cutting off every possible escape route before closing in to feast.",

As they swell in stature, becoming able to sprint as fast as a charging destrier, they begin to view themselves as a mounted elite under the command of the blessed courtiers. This delusion is deepened by the plaudits heaped upon them by the serfs, and this sense of their own majestic status perhaps spawns the compulsion to hoard remnants of past massacres like sacred relics.",

In the eyes of fellow cannibals, they shine with a holy radiance, their purity further proven by the alabaster pinions that adorn their backs. Those who have not received Ushoran’s blessing are instead greeted by the sight of leather-winged fiends dropping from the sky to land amongst them, unleashing sonic shrieks that burst eardrums and eyeballs even as the rancid stench of rotting carrion fills their mouths.\n\nCrypt Infernal Courtiers command the Deadwatch, the winged bodyguards of the nobility. When an abhorrant takes to the skies upon a mighty beast from their menagerie, they are often accompanied by their most loyal Infernals, hand-picked and bearing their own noble epithets and titles. To be permitted to touch a Crypt Infernal’s wings is a rare honour amongst ghouls, though any who approach these champions without permission risk being messily devoured.",

The lesser thralls of Ushoran see the Morbheg Knights as shining paladins that epitomise their liege-lord’s chivalric code and the beasts they ride as glorious winged horses. For all that this image is another grotesque symptom of the Flesh-eater curse, the bond between rider and nightshrieker is undeniably strong. The chiropteran mounts favour any beings that guide them to a bloody feast, and they carry their riders faithfully into the churn of melee, smashing enemies to the ground and glutting themselves upon warm blood while their ghoul masters strike out with rusty lances.",

Mordants who behold the stampede are overcome with a sense of awed humility, for they know that the beasts will deliver the king’s fury upon them if they are found wanting.",

Thus, he must bury himself in madness, throwing himself completely into his monstrous role. Should an enemy transgress against Ushoran’s decrees.

By invoking oaths sworn many centuries ago by civilisations that bowed before Ushoran, an abhorrant gives life to the buried dead that served their sovereign in bygone times. From lands soaked in the blood and tragedy of war they rise, once more fighting for the cause of their beloved lord. In the eyes of an abhorrant, the dead manifest as mighty spectral warriors, clad in ornate armour and carrying broad shields.\n\nBut these spectral defenders are an illusion seen only in the insane minds of the Flesh-eaters. It is not gleaming warriors that rise from the grave but mouldering corpses imbued with mindless hunger and rage. As they claw their way up through the ground, they drag with them twisted remnants of the ancient civilisation to which they once belonged – rusted palisades covered with gore and barbed fences that formerly surrounded mass graves. Blood spills forth from the wound in the earth, releasing a nauseating stench into the air, while cadaverous hands grasp at any foes foolish enough to stray within reach.",

Some of their prey fall swiftly, throats clawed out or hearts torn free by long, grasping fingers. Those less fortunate are still alive as the cannibals devour them. Despite this, ghouls believe themselves to be bringing salvation to the realms, and in the presence of the Flesh-eater nobility, their ‘valour’ reaches a manic intensity. Part of this ferocity is born from genuine devotion to the vampiric monarchy, but also responsible is the charnel stench of the abhorrants, which incites a frantic hunger in their underlings.\n\nAs lowly serfs, ghouls exist upon the edge of starvation. The scent of gore drives them wild with hunger, and when the odour mixes with that of their prey’s terror, the feeding frenzy that follows is horrific. Scrabbling across the earth on all fours, the Crypt Ghouls prove difficult targets to strike and close upon their prey with shocking swiftness. Though most are armed with nothing more than their claws and a few rancid bone clubs, ghouls attack in huge packs, bearing enemies down with their sheer weight of numbers and indulging their horrific cravings.",

So terrifying is he to look upon that it is easy to miss the fluctuating voices and inflections that spill from his gore-stained mouth – personas donned and discarded like so many masks, further proof of the Mortarch’s utter insanity. The only hint of Ushoran’s self-proclaimed regality is the crown that protrudes from his skull and the ‘royal sceptre’ he cradles in his taloned hands.\n\nAt any moment, Ushoran might tremble with rasping laughter or fly into a bloodthirsty rage that sees him tear enemies and allies alike limb from limb. This unpredictable madness is not only a shield against those seeking to manipulate or control him but also a weapon with which the Mortarch might dominate his foes. When the sickly haze of Ushoran’s mania is channelled through his crown and unleashed upon the sane, they are pulled into his web of derangement, turning upon their former comrades in a violent frenzy.",

Wielding Alakanash, the Staff of Power, the cursed blade Zefet-nebtar, and surrounded by the Nine Books of Nagash, the Great Necromancer commands the full, terrible power of Shyishan magic. With a contemptuous gesture, he tears the souls from the living, their last moments of agonising horror providing the fuel for his next arcane onslaught.\n\nNagash despises the unpredictable madness of the Flesh-eater Courts, which he sees as entirely antithetical to his own desire for sterile domination. In ages past, Ushoran drew Nagash’s ire with some great transgression, for which the Mortarch was punished terribly. In spite of this, many Flesh‑eaters – in their own deranged way – worship the Great Necromancer with disturbing fervour, envisioning him as a benevolent master of the underworlds. In his presence, they fight with unrestrained ferocity, believing that they honour him with every foe they rip into pieces and messily devour.",

To join them, an abhorrant must make pilgrimage to the Mortarch’s court and sup the Summerking’s ichor and spittle from his sacred chalice. Only those of unshakeable faith can endure the resulting convulsions; in doing so, they gain an unconscious ability to shape the delusions of ghouls around them. They deliver bloody offerings to Nagash and perform miraculous feats that pitch their flocks into even greater frenzies.\n\nThis ability to manipulate delusions sees the Cardinals leading missionary efforts into Sigmarite nations. They enter enemy territory through hidden catacombs and densely packed meat-wagons, drawing mortals who have been infected by Ushoran’s curse into their embrace. In forgotten crypts, forest clearings and abandoned strongpoints, Cardinals now lead cults that give praise to the Summerking, and not even the feared witch-hunters of Sigmar’s Order of Azyr can fully determine their spread.",

Taking the title of Royal Decapitator, they don filthy patchwork hoods and take up rusted axes recovered from the midden heaps, weapons that have taken so many lives that they seem to hunger for death.\n\nSeen as dour and uncultured by their fellows, Decapitators are shunned figures, forced to dwell in isolated bone-strewn lairs. Yet they are nevertheless permitted to accompany the royal host to battle, and when these cannibals spy an enemy who excites their murderous impulses, a slavering mania seizes them. The Decapitator lopes forwards with a single minded focus, shrugging off arrows and lead shot, dragging their axe in a furrow through the mud. So occupied are their targets with fighting off hordes of rabid ghouls that few notice the heavy blade whistling towards them until it cleaves them in two.",
