      "lore": "The ground trembles and a charnel reek fills the air as a Gothizzar Harvester lumbers forward, joints clicking as it trawls through the carrion left behind by war. These massive constructs embody the grotesque pragmatism of the Ossiarch Bonereapers. They are designed not only to slaughter the enemy with bladed limbs and gouts of green spirit-flame but also to gather the slain up in the osseous cage atop their back, where a multitude of dexterous appendages proceed to strip flesh from bone and process the bounty of corpses. Indeed, a Gothizzar Harvester’s passage across the lands can be tracked by the grim trail of flesh, gristle and empty armour left in its wake.\n\nEven in the thick of battle, the Harvester’s duties continue, as it amasses a gruesome stockpile that can be used to repair a legion’s casualties on the field. Despite their value as force multipliers, Ossiarch commanders typically use Harvesters to smash openings in the enemy’s formation, bludgeoning and hacking their way through a mass of bodies. As they trample forwards, distress soon turns to blind terror and precipitates panicked retreats – even bold warriors can be forgiven for fleeing as they watch their comrades being slaughtered, picked apart and processed before their very eyes.",

Anything unfortunate enough to stand between the spell and its intended target is simply obliterated. The Predator’s ethereal claws lash out to lacerate the bodies of its screaming victims, stripping their flesh to the bone before tossing them aside.",

To aid him in this, the Mortarch of Sacrament was granted full control of the Bonereaper legion known as the Null Myriad, which he leads on bitter campaigns of suppression and annihilation against the living.\n\nArkhan’s command of necromancy is bettered only by Nagash himself, and in battle, he unleashes its full might upon any who dare impede his master’s plans. Mounted atop the dread abyssal Razarak and wielding the Staff of Spirits, the Mortarch summons surging storms of amethyst energy, sending this deadly cascade crashing down upon his victims and turning them to withered husks. The soulstuff of these unfortunates – ripped from their flesh as it turns to dust – is devoured by Arkhan, mending any damage done to his physical form and further empowering his magic.",

Freed from direct control, it dives and swoops above the heads of the Ossiarchs’ foes, radiating such a baleful aura of doom that even the bravest souls find their resolve to fight ebbing away, replaced with a sense of existential dread.",

Attendant engineers then operate the Crawler’s mechanisms, loading and directing the weapon at the heart of the enemy’s formation. At the signal of a high-ranking war vizier, the Crawler’s main arm lurches forwards, hurling a payload of glowing missiles towards its target.\n\nA Crawler’s ammunition consists not of physical matter but of fiendish concentrations of deathly energy. The most commonly used projectiles are clusters of necrotically charged skulls. Where these land, they burst in a storm of sorcery that shatters stone and blasts the life from nearby soldiers. Sometimes, a Crawler will be loaded with strange, polyhedral steles inscribed with grim hexes, designed to unleash a concentrated burst of death magic against a single target. More insidious still are the cauldrons of torment: warded containers filled with tormented soul-slivers, which burst upon impact and fill the air with a maddening aura of terror and pain that drives mortals hopelessly insane.",

      "lore": "A genius of war whose mastery of strategy and tactics is unrivalled, Orpheon Katakros was chosen by Nagash to oversee the obliteration of mortal life and the final victory of death over life. The Mortarch of the Necropolis appears as a true goliath of war, his osseous frame shaped into a vision of anatomical perfection, his baleflame gaze observing the advance of his Ossiarch hosts with cold, analytical satisfaction. Katakros eschews the petty cruelties and political infighting of Nagash’s other Mortarchs. He seeks only complete perfection on the battlefield and in the arena of empire-building.\n\nKatakros prefers to observe each battle from a strategically advantageous point, surrounded by a retinue of trusted acolytes. Here he analyses the flow of combat, dispatching a flurry of orders via avian bone-constructs and signalling complex manoeuvres through his Prime Necrophoros, who bears the Mortarch’s personal standard. He has little interest in personal combat, leaving such matters to his ever-present subordinate, the Liege-Immortis Karash. If a particularly worthy foe makes themselves known, however, Katakros will take up the ensorcelled spear Inda-Khaat and the Shield Immortis, disposing of his opponent with the same precision with which he directs his legions.",

When selecting souls to animate the first of these mages, Nagash prioritised craftsmen of ability and renown. The underworlds were practically ransacked for such spirits, the artisans’ inclination to fashion works of beauty perverted to the purpose of war and the veneration of their malignant god. A skilled Boneshaper can keep an Ossiarch cohort fighting on despite tremendous losses, supplementing their necromantic repairs with the skeletal remains of those the Bonereapers have recently slain.\n\nOf course, such mastery of osseous matter can also be directly weaponised if the situation demands it. Appearing frailer than their combat-ready counterparts, the Mortisans are often singled out as easy targets – a delusion that only lasts until they summon a storm of razor-sharp bone shards to eviscerate any would-be assailants. Should the enemy manage to close to melee range, the Boneshaper’s talons – primarily designed for delicate sculpting – are more than capable of ripping out throats or piercing hearts.",

Denied the glory of martial victory, they now perform only the most brutish and honourless tasks: conquering monster-ridden forests, hunting down troublesome raiders and seeking out valuable troves of osseous matter.

Embittered and shamed by their new duties, they must nevertheless lead a motley retinue of Teratic warriors to victory in Nagash’s name.

A Soulmason possesses encyclopaedic knowledge of the spiritual reserves available to them and knows precisely how much to call upon to energise or repair damaged warriors. They are famous for their trance-like focus, able to split their blended consciousness and perform a dizzying array of calculations at once.\n\nWhile Soulmasons are adept at aggressive spellcraft, their true value lies in bolstering the spirits of fellow Ossiarchs. Through their soul alchemy, these Mortisans provide aetheric nourishment to the Bonereapers, heightening their ferocity and focus. Such complex forms of sorcery beyond any Necromancer, and the Soulmasons must retain total concentration when wielding them, otherwise the welling gheist-energies may burst free in a shrieking mass. To avoid having to distract themselves with combat, Soulmasons take to battle atop elaborate bipedal thrones, whose raking claws can keep foes at a safe distance.",

Arrows, blades and arcane projectiles ricochet off these creatures, their charge not slowing a jot. When a Deathrider echelon slams home, it is akin to being hit by an avalanche, and their nadirite weapons – as well as the fangs and sharpened tails of their steeds – ensure that the Kavaloi rarely leave survivors in their wake.\n\nThough they take great pride in their martial skill, the Kavaloi riders are as disciplined on the battlefield as any other Bonereapers, befitting their status as warriors of the elite Priad warrior caste. They avoid the wild, glory-seeking charges that are so often the undoing of mortal or even immortal cavaliers; instead, the Deathriders’ Hekatos leaders form their troops into tight and precise wedges to plunge into enemy formations. Once the foe’s cohesion is shattered, the Deathriders will bid their steeds wheel away with an eerie synchrony or else ride on through terrain no normal horse would dare.",

It is claimed that they have never routed, and Katakros himself rarely takes to the field without a contingent at his side. More so than any other class of Ossiarchs, the Immortis Guard view their cohorts as single entities and each warrior as merely an element of the whole. They speak in an eerie, emotionless unity and coordinate their defences through a faint telepathic bond. It is said that the only time an Immortis Guard experiences a flicker of sentiment is when one of their brethren is irrevocably felled in the line of duty.

For these deathless artisans, quality is the only true metric, and they view themselves as pioneers as well as masters in matters of craftsmanship. As battle rages around them, they work their sorceries to augment their creations’ violent potential or resilience. Super‑hardened barbs erupt along the forelimbs of Gothizzar Harvesters, while Mortek Crawlers are coated in layers of ensorcelled bone that absorb kinetic energy before unleashing it with lethal force.",

Riding at the head of the Ossiarch’s elite cavalry formations, Zandtos seeks to annihilate all those who bear the taint of mortality, banishing their presence from his beloved realm for good. Such is his zealotry on this subject that even Katakros has on occasion had cause to censure the Arch-Kavalos for indulging his ruthless aggression. Yet the Mortarch of the Necropolis never keeps Zandtos leashed for long, because his mastery of cavalry warfare is a weapon too valuable to be cast aside.\n\nWielding the fabled Dark Lance itself – both a murderous weapon and an exalted staff of office – Arch-Kavalos Zandtos charges into battle eagerly, plunging his weapon through the flesh of his foes while his warsteed stomps and kicks furiously. His hatred of mortalkind is so intense that it affects nearby Kavalos riders, stirring the smouldering embers of their souls into a battle-fury that sees them recklessly hurtle into combat in pursuit of victory.",

The Mortisans use this energy to fuel their scythe swings, to sap their enemies’ strength or to imbue nearby Ossiarchs with a sudden burst of aggression. Whatever soul-power a Soulreaper does not expend in this fashion is sealed within the grave-sand repositories that hang around their waist. In this form, the souls are transferred to a necropolis and secured in its vaults until the order to animate more Ossiarch warriors is received.",

They are also surprisingly swift despite their size, capable of closing the distance with their prey in just a few loping strides. Yet by far their most infamous feature is their four-faced quadrarch masks. These are designed to do more than merely unnerve; into each identical visage is bound the soul of a legendary warrior from across the realms, each of whom favoured a particular martial form.\n\nThe Mortisans have further sharpened the specialist talents of Necropolis Stalkers by stripping away even more of the souls’ distracting individuality than is typical, rendering them akin to machines. In battle, a Necropolis Stalker can bring one of these spirit fragments and their respective skills to the forefront of their consciousness, signified by their mask rotating until a new head faces forwards. As a result, Stalkers are supremely adaptive killers, equally capable against hordes of lesser enemies and coteries of armoured elites.",

Cruel and tyrannical, the overlord of Shyish intends to conquer the Mortal Realms and transform them into a lifeless Necrotopia, in which not a speck of dust moves unless it is by his will. Wielding Alakanash, the Staff of Power, the cursed blade Zefet-nebtar, and surrounded by the Nine Books of Nagash, the Great Necromancer commands the full, terrible power of Shyishan magic. With a contemptuous gesture, he tears the souls from the living, their last moments of agonising horror providing the fuel for his next arcane onslaught.\n\nTo the Ossiarchs, Nagash is a creator god of dark majesty, the being that will bring about a true golden age for undead across the Mortal Realms. In his presence, they fight all the harder, inspired by a sense of devotion that is no less intense than any mortal’s religious fervour. When combined with the martial excellence of the Ossiarch legions, Nagash’s magic can unmake any foe, leaving the lands littered with corpses. These precious resources are soon gathered and stripped of their soft and vulnerable flesh, refined into osseous fuel for further conquests.",

      "lore": "Mortek Guard are the passionless heart of the Ossiarch legions. Though numerous in comparison to other Bonereaper constructs, they are no mindless chattel. The blend of warlike personalities that pulses within each Mortek’s soultrap gem grants the capacity for autonomy, though only a flicker – enough to adapt to changing circumstances and venerate Nagash without the possibility of any troubling notions of individuality shining through. Their strikes are clinical and efficient, whether delivered with nadirite spears and swords or with the greatblades favoured by those Morteks fashioned from the mutilated souls of berserkers and weaponmasters.\n\nDiscipline is the watchword of the Mortek Guard, the fulcrum upon which their successes turn. They cannot be bribed, induced to panic or burdened by despair; if they feel anything, it is only satisfaction at demonstrating the Bonereapers’ battlefield mastery. Whether they fight upon desert sands or beneath the canopies of flesh-eating trees, the Mortek Guard endure the harshest conditions without comment. Corpses pile around their feet as they kill with machine-like efficiency, preferring to preserve the bones of their victims whenever possible so that their final tally might contribute to the endless tithe.",

Once they have inflicted sufficient ruin and shock, a Liege-Kavalos leads their riders to smash from the foe’s back ranks, wheel about and repeat the process; many boast that they could trample an entire civilisation beneath their hooves if given a single lance of Deathriders and enough time to see it done.\n\nLiege-Kavaloi are the satraps and provincial lords of the Bonereapers’ empire, charged with custodianship of the necropolises and expansion of the Necrotopia. The proud souls that animate them were, in life, renowned for their ability to inspire fanatical loyalty; in death, that force of will drives those undead they command onwards without pause, to the horror of the living. Ossiarch footsoldiers obey the orders of their Liege-Kavalos without hesitation or delay; this complete obedience, when combined with the Liege-Kavalos’s military genius, has secured countless stunning victories in the name of the Ossiarch Empire.",
