This is no will-o’-the-wisp or magical illusion but the lantern of a sorcerous Guardian of Souls. These drifting creatures are nexuses of undead energy, and they form the focal point of many a Nighthaunt host. They are guardians only in that they preserve the lesser gheists from banishment back to Shyish, for Nagash still has need of their hatred in the other realms.\n\nAs mortals, these so-called guardians each dabbled in the dark arts of undeath, but after realising they trod a perilous downward spiral, they stepped away – a weakness of morality that the Great Necromancer neither forgot nor forgave. Upon their deaths, Nagash remade these former magic users as unliving conduits for the necromantic energy they once spurned. The ornate lanterns they carry invigorate the dead and gheists are drawn to them as a starving peasant is drawn to the window of a feast hall. These lesser undead are given new animus, bound into a host of ravening spirits ready to annihilate the living in the name of the Great Necromancer.",

The Mortalis Terminexus is a gigantic hourglass of fate that is conjured into being ahead of a Nighthaunt procession, announcing their coming and distorting the passage of time.\n\nThe shimmering form of a Mortalis Terminexus can hasten death or restore energy to the Nighthaunt legions, depending upon which side it is turned. Its mere presence can quicken the pace of Death’s armies, allowing this conjuration to absorb slivers of energy from those recently deceased left in the Nighthaunt’s wake. Conversely, the Terminexus can invert with a grinding creak at the whim of its spectral caster, reversing the flow of time and undoing any damage nearby gheists may have sustained.",

Unusually amongst the ranks of the Nighthaunt, the Lord Executioner was once a deliverer of justice rather than a criminal who defied it. These figures were held in fear in life, for their calling was that of the headsman, their duty to decapitate or hang those who flouted the law. Theirs was a task attended to with diligent dedication, even relish.\n\nSome such executioners become enamoured with their craft. Towards the end of their tenures, they did not look too closely at the circumstances surrounding each kill, though they told themselves they were always acting in the name of civil stricture and order. Nagash has stripped away that pretence, and now they take head from neck without such mortal qualms. To look upon them is to know that one’s crimes have been judged by a pitiless arbiter, and all that awaits is the bitter embrace of the grave.",

The twin heralds who hover at their monarch’s side – the souls of two brothers Valentian had murdered in his pursuit of power – do not regale him with tales of his triumphs but instead mock and denigrate him eternally. Endlessly tormented by their words yet unable to lash out because of the sorceries that bind him, Kurdoss seeks an outlet for his immortal anguish in battle.\n\nIn the press of combat, Valentian swings his enormous mace with skull-crushing force, finding some catharsis in every slain champion or butchered monster. Yet even this is tainted by the knowledge that he is little more than a crude implement to be wielded by his liege, Lady Olynder. He is unable even to speak without her permission, and nothing but grave-dust spills from his mouth when he tries to bellow an order or curse a foe. So powerful is Valentian’s aura of bitter silence that even enemy leaders find their commands dying on their lips. For if the Craven King cannot rule, then no mortal king may do so in his stead.",

Thus, Nighthaunt hex-mages have mastered the conjuring of an arcane chest known as a Vault of Souls – a repository into which those disembodied spirits are drawn and trapped, so that they might be remade into the cursed forms of Nighthaunt.\n\nSometimes, however, the sheer quantity of captured spirits is too vast even for those incantations to hold. Glutting itself too greedily, the Vault of Souls will begin to tremble and crack, the animate matter within attempting to break free in desperation. If this should occur, the results are devastating, as a lethal implosion of soul energy bursts from the Vault, blasting the life from any mortals nearby. Nighthaunt spellcasters have even learnt to trigger this detonation intentionally, to the horror of their enemies.",

While they prefer slowly peeling their prey apart, Cruciators wield various flensing knives and other razor-sharp implements that can swiftly eviscerate anyone foolish enough to challenge them in single combat. These fearsome gheists can even draw arcane power from the suffering of those around them, channelling this trauma into a beacon of death magic that strengthens nearby Nighthaunt, rendering them almost impossible to banish.",

Taken by Nagash and remade as a spectral monarch, she now feels everything she professed to and more. Sheer, entropic sorrow radiates from her like a crushing wave, causing plants to wither and warriors to collapse in paroxysms of horror. Unhurried, Lady Olynder drifts towards them, reaching for her funerary veil with pallid fingers. When she reveals her true face, all who look upon it perish in an instant of paralysing terror.\n\nLady Olynder is accompanied at all times by a retinue of ghostly handmaidens, whose banshee screams combine with the Mortarch’s own malign presence to stop the hearts of the weak-willed. These attendants carry with them a cursed hourglass – a symbol of the fate that awaits all mortals. When shattered, this relic is able to stop the flow of time entirely, freezing Lady Olynder’s victims on the spot in a state of utmost horror.",

Unlike their Cairn Wraith cousins, Grimghast Reapers do not kill purposefully and deliberately but scythe down those before them with unnatural vigour. As mortals, they sought to eliminate both rivals and friends without getting a drop of blood on their hands. As wraiths, they spend eternity spilling torrents of gore, little more than ethereal weapons doing the Great Necromancer’s butcher-work.\n\nGrimghast Reapers are blindfolded or bound so that even the pale witchsight of the undead is denied to them. Their cogent thought is shattered by the peals of the bell rung by the pack’s Extoller, one who spoke against Nagash in life and is condemned to sing his praises in death. Driven into a murderous fugue state by Nagash’s will, the reapers are set loose upon those they once called kin – for the Great Necromancer reasons that if they so enjoy killing their allies, they should be given the chance to do so on a far wider scale.",

Spirit Torments swing these malefic weapons with incredible might, chuckling darkly as the hefty iron padlocks that cap each chain strike their enemies with the force of a cannonball.\n\nYet the true horror of a Spirit Torment lies in their ability to trammel the life force of the slain into those same enchanted padlocks. Escape from these eldritch prisons is all but impossible – it is said they are even able to capture the discorporating energies of Stormcast Eternals before they can return to the heavens. All Spirit Torments get a dark satisfaction from peering into the depths of their arcane prisons and observing the miseries of those trapped within. In consuming their captives’ last vestiges of hope, each Torment becomes a locus of dread, empowering their fellow Nighthaunt even as mortals are assailed by waves of disconsolate terror.",

It is an icon of death, a reaper known and feared by every people in every land, for amongst all the greater spirits of the Nighthaunt processions, the Cairn Wraith is the most widespread. It takes no scholar of the dead to know that the bite of its scythe can cut a man’s soul from his body to leave a cooling corpse behind, reaping the living in great swinging arcs should they gather en masse. Likewise, even the merest street urchin knows this creature’s cruel hand can pass through flesh and bone alike, reaching in to still the heart of its prey.\n\nAs to their origin, some believe the Cairn Wraiths were once mass murderers or delvers into ancient lore who made pacts to extend their lifespans that went horribly wrong. The truth is that each has its own history of fell deeds and that they seek only to extend their sagas of slaughter. Solitary creatures, they can be bound to the service of a greater undead only through painstaking ritual – though given the bow wave of terror they can inspire in the living, such rites of binding are invariably time well spent.",

Crowds of these Dreadscythe Harridans thrash and scream as they fall upon the living. Outwardly, they are the most unsettling of killers; though they wear roses in their hair and trail once-fine robes behind them, their skull-like faces are locked in a rictus of deathly glee as they slash and stab, welters of blood bursting out from each blow. Inwardly, these creatures are still gentle and kind, but Nagash has ensured they are trapped and forced to witness the rampage of their new incarnation with mounting despair.",

These creatures need not move too swiftly, for to them, time is all but immaterial. They were once hunters of men, joyful and magnificent upon their swift steeds, relishing the heart pounding thrill of the chase. The fact that their quarry was often innocent of any crime was of no import to them.\n\nWhen the killers met their final ends, they found themselves given a new hunt to partake in. Now they drift steadily in packs, pursuing their given prey to the heartbeat thump of a drum made from human skin. No glory do they take in this morbid hunt, for their sense of enjoyment or predatory glee is replaced by a cold and steady surety. Once it has its target, a Glaivewraith Stalker will never relent until it slides its blade through its luckless victim’s chest.",

      "lore": "Thundering through the darkening gloom, a Black Coach goes where its wraithlike steersman wills it, the team of undead horses at the fore galloping at uncanny speed but never tiring. The coach can cross chasms and battle lines alike, for it is held aloft as often by the spirit energy surrounding it as it is by metal-bound wheels. At will, its driver can shift the carriage’s form from the ectoplasmic to the physical; when the coach slams into the enemy, it hurls them broken to the ground, the sheer impact of its hurtling mass enough to kill even before the spirit host bound to it claws and stabs at the survivors.\n\nA Black Coach is a hearse of sorts, yet it is far more than a conveyance for the cursed entity entombed within. The coach is a lodestone for unnatural magic, and the coffin inside is bathed in Shyishan energy wherever it roams. The more people it kills, the more these ending magics intensify. The energies that thrum through the coach’s chassis have a powerful debilitating effect on the living and are focused like light through a prism until the sarcophagus inside is awash with baleful magic. The artefacts precious to the creature within are borne alongside it by spectral relic bearers, ghostly forms awaiting that fateful night when their master rises to claim them once more.",

When they strike home, the results are horrendous to behold.\n\nArmour counts for naught in the face of such a weapon, which is shaped from the purest energies of death. Moreover, a Shyish Reaper can strike from any angle at any time, sometimes emerging beneath a targeted formation of warriors to slice upwards through them. As the bisected bodies of its victims collapse, their souls are torn loose and sent screaming into the underworlds, there to be judged and punished at the Great Necromancer’s leisure.",

King Reikenor hoped to banish the curse of death, freeing his people to live forever. Nagash himself punished Reikenor for his hubris, tearing out his soul. Displaying his usual talent for ironic cruelty, Nagash remade the sorcerer-king’s spirit into the dread form of the Grimhailer – the leering, spectral fiend who would become his prime executioner. Reikenor now hunts mortals who seek to defy death’s cold embrace, persecuting those who commit the very crimes for which he was sentenced to oblivion.\n\nSoaring through the night atop his cadaverous winged steed Kyllaron, the Grimhailer tracks down these blasphemers. He is the reaper of souls, but his necrotically empowered scythe is not his deadliest weapon: with a pinch of his bony fingers, Reikenor snuffs out a candle atop his steed, instantly extinguishing the animus of one who displeased the Great Necromancer so that their corpse falls lifeless to the ground.",

Breaking their oaths and damning their souls forever, they abandoned their people to Nagash’s justice – only to fall into the Great Necromancer’s clutches themselves. Nagash, for his part, interpreted their betrayal not as cowardice but as wisdom, seeing value in commanders who understood that to resist his will was madness. Seized upon death and remade into cloaked wraiths, the shroud-knights now lead the hosts of the Nighthaunt into battle, compounding the weakness in their soul with every mortal army they send to the grave.\n\nTraitors they might be, but a Knight of Shrouds still possesses a savvy understanding of military matters and a formidable talent for single combat. With the Sword of Stolen Hours that marks their rank, a Knight of Shrouds cuts down those heroes they once considered their peers and adds their siphoned vitality to their own. These wraith generals are consumed by self-hatred, of course, but when turned outwards, dark emotion can be a powerful motivator – a fact Nagash knows better than any other being in the realms.",

There is a piercing scream as it reappears, charging at the observer and levelling its sword so it bursts right through their chest. As its victim slumps, dying, to the bloodsoaked ground, the Dreadblade Harrow discorporates with an eerie laugh.\n\nOnce, these phantasmal entities were noble cavaliers in the service of an officer who would later become a Knight of Shrouds. Champions all, they stood by whilst their masters betrayed their office, their people, even life itself. By their silence they were damned, for to do nothing in the face of evil is a sin unto itself. Not a trace of honour can be found amongst them; if they find any gratification, it is in the most heinous and unchivalrous of deeds. Outriders and bodyguards for the monarchy of the dead, they have become the Knights of Regret, riding incorporeal on the winds of Shyish to slay, discorporate and slay again without the slightest remorse.",

Such cruel and needless murder was pleasing to Nagash, who remade Awlrach as a hunched and towering gheist. He ordered his new servant to row forever across the Mortal Realms, slaying mortals and delivering their souls to the underworlds.\n\nThe Drowner is unusual amongst the Nighthaunt hordes, for he truly relishes his eternal duty. To look upon this faceless murderer is to gaze into a black abyss of evil – an entity that commits atrocity not because he is driven to by compulsion but simply because he enjoys it. Awlrach’s work is never done. Always there is more living prey to drown in deathly energy; always there are more spirits desperate to climb from the corpse-strewn soil onto his barque rather than dwindle to nothingness in the boiling ectoplasm of his wake.",

Nagash, for his part, interpreted their betrayal not as cowardice but as wisdom, seeing value in commanders who understood that to resist his will was madness. Seized upon death and remade into cloaked wraiths, the shroud-knights now lead the hosts of the Nighthaunt into battle, compounding the weakness in their soul with every mortal army they send to the grave.\n\nMany a Knight of Shrouds takes to the battlefield atop an ethereal steed, favouring the speed and killing power of such a being. They cut a fearsome sight as they order their screeching soldiery forward in a gushing tide of ectoplasm, spurring them on to take their vengeance against the living. When the outcome of the fighting seems determined, the Knight of Shrouds will join the slaughter, their Sword of Stolen Hours stealing the life from their foes while their mount lashes out with hooves and a raking bite.",

They are clad in heavy chains of cursed blackiron, these fetters alloyed with the most despairing of emotions. Known to the sepulchre-keepers and deathseers of Shyish as ghastflails, these dread weapons are the means by which the Chainghasts reap more souls for their masters. When whirled with sufficient force, these flails build up a charge of purest misery – an amethyst aura that is then unleashed to fly outwards as spectral bolts of flame. These are no normal fires, for they can burn the target’s very soul. Even those who survive are left catatonic and broken, easy prey for the Nighthaunt to overwhelm.",

They are not only his propagandists but the arbiters of his grim truths, bidden to terminally censor any who would defy their place in his vision.\n\nShould they learn the true name of a troublesome mortal, these scribes will note it down, assigning their soul to an underworld judged a fitting punishment. Boisterous warriors expecting to feast alongside their ancestors are left stranded amidst endless tundra, while crusaders against the undead stand forever immobile amongst hellscapes filled with shuffling, stinking cadavers. By carrying out esoteric rites and snuffing out an enchanted candle, the Scriptors can bring such a marked mortal’s existence to a sudden close. Enemies may strive to banish a Scriptor before their sentence is carried out, but given the presence of the other Nighthaunt drawn to and empowered by their flickering wychlight candles, this is easier said than done.",

It is that panic that Nagash has turned into a weapon.\n\nThese ill-fated spirits’ crime was nothing more than meeting especially tormenting fates. Some of their number died imprisoned inside spike-laden iron maidens; others were sealed into coffins and sank beneath the waves or walled up alive where none could find them. The thrashing desperation that overcame them in those last moments, the animal urge to cling onto life, needled Nagash’s petty temper. Working his fell magics, the Great Necromancer has eternally trapped the Bladegheists in their final moments of frenetic strength, lashing out in vain to save themselves without any conception of the damage they are wreaking. In truth, they swing razored greatswords back and forth, lopping off limbs and heads as they whirl like drunken dervishes in a futile attempt to escape their doom.",

These weapons – wreathed in baleflame – sever the metaphysical cords that binds soul to body, leaving only senseless corpses slumping in the Hexwraiths’ wake.\n\nHexwraiths were gifted horsemen in life. Their only crime was to delight in mounted battle above all else and fail to pay proper homage to the Great Necromancer. Their reward in death is for that love to be turned into an unstoppable weapon; they find themselves trapped atop a grotesque echo of their favoured steed for evermore. The Hexwraith can never rest, for the ride is eternal, and Nagash ensures that every moment in which they fail to please him with offerings of slain mortals is spent in burning agony.",
