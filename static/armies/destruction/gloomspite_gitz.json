      "lore": "One of the most destructive races to have ever lived, the Drogrukh were centauroid warriors who built a great nation in the Realm of Beasts. From their number rose a champion so powerful that he ascended to godhood: Kragnos, the End of Empires. Having led his people in warfare against a draconic empire that left the Drogrukh all but extinct, Kragnos was sealed away for the protection of the realms – only to be freed centuries later. Though he currently wages a protracted war in the Realm of Life, Kragnos can still be drawn to battle by the most ferocious fighting, his arrival announced by the smashing of enemy lines and the crushing of foes under his thunderous hooves.\n\nAlready a natural disaster made manifest, Kragnos’s rampages are further augmented by his legendary armaments. The shield Tuskbreaker is said to have been cast aside by Gorkamorka himself, deity of the orruks and other brutish beings. The spells of enemy mages break instantly upon its surface, supposedly due to the residual divine essence that suffuses it. The Dread Mace, Kragnos’s massive studded club, is powerful enough to shatter walls of solid rock. Legends say that Kragnos retrieved the weapon’s head from an ancient geomantic nexus, and that it is infused with Ghur’s own destructive animus.",

He attributes his success to the Bad Moon, which he claims once spoke to him directly. Its jabbering came to him as he slept, filling his mind with tidings of its approach. When Skragrott awoke, a fungal crown was deeply rooted upon his brow, its tendrils touching his brain. This Badloon Bossfungus was seen as proof by all the Moonclans of his right to rule and a conduit through which he could channel their sinister god’s power. When the Loonking’s assault on Ayadah coincided with the rising of the Bad Moon just as he said it would, Skragrott’s infamy was assured.\n\nThat said, Skragrott recognised that one successful prediction could be discredited. He bade his minions capture mages and prognosticators and drag them back to his fortress of Skrappa Spill. By sieving through their deranged prophecies, Skragrott can extract information that accurately points to the coming of the Bad Moon. Equipped with this knowledge, he leads his great horde into battle with swaggering confidence, empowering them with the lunar entity’s light. Once the fighting is well underway, he uses his magical might to call down loonstone meteors to crush packed groups of foes.",

What makes the Arachnaroks truly unsettling, however, is the malign intellect within their eight eyes.\n\nThe only grots that seem truly respected by the Arachnaroks are the Webspinner Shamans, high viziers of the Spider God. The arachnids favour the most mutated and lunatic of these rulers, for in imbibing copious amounts of venom, a crude kinship may develop between them. Webspinner Shamans are driven by their fervent desire to please the Spider God. They believe that their deity wishes the Everdank to cover the lands, so that all of its arachnid children can spill forth and hunt forever amidst the twilight shadows. This belief, coupled with the constant need to appease the hungry Arachnaroks that dwell in their nests, makes Webspinner Shamans warlike leaders.",

Yet occasionally there are those who defy death at every opportunity, eventually becoming known as Squigbosses.

Squigbosses have few mates amongst the Moonclans, who find anyone that even a squig refuses to eat highly suspect. Going to battle alongside their faithful Gnasha-squigs, whose company they vastly prefer to that of other grots, they drive the bouncing throngs forwards with jabs and blows from their squig‑krooks.\n\nSquigbosses possess a deep knowledge of rare fungi and its effects on their squiggly flock. They know just how much Crimson Deffcap will get the creatures bouncing at optimal speed, the blends of Yellow Lurka that grant their spittle toxic qualities, and the strains of Sproutin’ Moon that see rows of extra, swordlike fangs push up through their gums. By feeding the beasts fungal clusters produced from folds within their filthy robes, a Squigboss can inspire an unstoppable bestial onslaught.",

They make their lairs within turgid riverbanks, deep marshes and city sewers, quite content to linger amidst congealed muck until instinct compels them to head off in search of grosser pastures. Their hides ooze with noxious slime, and the scent they emit is enough to turn even a hardened Ironjaw’s guts. Of course, each one is also a powerhouse in its own right, its prodigious size and fearsome regenerative capabilities allowing it to take on several foes at once. These troggoths favour weapons such as big spiked clubs inset with stones or the bones of their prey.\n\nA Fellwater’s most distinctive quirk, however, is its ability to heave up a stream of highly caustic vomit against which even steel plate offers little protection. It is said that there is no environment too rank for a Fellwater, not even the malignant lairs of the Kruleboyz. This fact has not escaped grotkind, many of whom derive great entertainment from prodding packs of the beasts towards bog-orruk hideouts before standing back to watch the carnage, all while hoping that the troggoths do not decide they are hungry for grot-meat instead and turn around to waddle after them in a hungry furore.",

What makes the Arachnaroks truly unsettling, however, is the malign intellect within their eight eyes.\n\nThere are various breeds of Arachnaroks, but none are more revered by the Spiderfang than the Skitterstrands. These creatures possess a form of sight that allows them to perceive the quivering strands of mortality. They crawl forth from an underworld known as the Evercrawl, skittering through web strewn tunnels in reality before emerging to pounce upon unsuspecting prey. Skitterstrands are drawn to battlefields, for the roiling emotions of combatants and frenzied rituals of the Spiderfang set the soul-webs quivering like nothing else. Even the most jaded warriors have had their minds snapped by the sight of a Skitterstrand’s eight limbs slowly unfolding from a rift in the aether behind their lines – before the beast sets about them with terrifying dexterity and speed.",

The newly created Fanatic is then dosed with temporarily immobilising concoctions, so they may be carried into the fray without harming their peers, before being let loose, forcing enemies and allies alike to dive for cover.\n\nSome Fanatics eschew iron balls in favour of Thwackwheezer Puffshrooms. When agitated, this spongy fungus emits clouds of lung-clogging spores, and being spun around at high velocity causes them to release their toxic payloads in billowing clouds that linger and drift around the battlefield. Those who wield Thwackwheezers are known as Sporesplattas, and their fumes see the mania of any nearby Gitz deepen while foes violently cough up their dissolving lungs – at least until the surprisingly weighty Puffshroom clobbers them in the face with a wet thrrrp sound.",

The most powerful of all troggkind, he can take a hit from a cannonball without flinching, and even the sharpest war-pick struggles to penetrate his hide. He wields a club big enough to cave in the hull of a Steam Tank, its head fashioned from the fossilised carapace of an ironshell snail. Deadlier even than Trugg’s terrifying strength is the arcane structure atop his back. When the Troggoth King stomps into battle, the runes on the leystone glow white-hot and arcane energies spill from its aperture.\n\nDepending upon which realm the leystone is attuned to, a different phenomenon will manifest. When the Ghyran sigil flares, Trugg’s powers of regeneration are sent into overdrive, allowing his wounded flesh to regrow in moments. When attuned to Aqshy, the Troggoth King is wreathed in flames to which he and his minions are impervious but that hungrily devour his foes. Trugg is too dimwitted to control the leystone’s powers beyond bashing it with his club, but his thick skull safeguards him from the worst effects of being in close proximity to such a potent source of magic.",

Only when live victims are plunged screaming into the bubbling broth that sloshes around in its iron belly will it impart its gifts. Should one drink deeply from the cauldron without tribute, then the Arachnacauldron will drag the caster into its mouth, absorbing them into its slurried contents along with anyone else close at hand.\n\nSo the story goes, Scrapskuttle was the eponymous grot shaman responsible for the creation of this entity. So lazy was the mage that he sought to make his cauldron self-sufficient, empowering it with the ability to grab ingredients by itself to keep the brew within bubbling along. However, after one kick too many from its master, the Arachnacauldron swallowed up Scrapskuttle himself. His exceptionally well-cooked remains still simmer within its mystical contents to this day, the shaman’s enchantment clearly having worked a little too well.",

Not so these wolf-riding grots, who will chase distant Hysh from horizon to horizon each day.\n\nTo this end, they have forged an alliance of convenience with the Snarlfangs, a breed of especially large and cruel lupine whose saliva is toxic in the extreme. These wolves see Hysh as the one enemy they cannot stare down, for it sears their eyesight. Thus, the ancestors of these wolves pledged to help the grots in their quest gain power over the sun.\n\nWhen this deadly combination of grot and wolf catches the scent of prey, they strike with merciless glee. If the crude arrows of the grots – fired from the saddle even at high speed – do not make the kill, their crooked spears and the jaws of their mounts will when they pounce on a vulnerable foe and tear them to shreds.",

A grot horde pitched to the heights of frenzy will happily spend hundreds of lives to overwhelm an enemy; after all, there are always more where they came from.\n\nShootas wield crude shortbows and honour the Gloomspite tradition of targeting an enemy that can’t reach you. This is considered somewhat of a luxury amongst the mobs. However, only those capable of making or scavenging a bow can remain within the safety of the rearguard. Arguments often break out if one grot thinks they deserve to be shooting on the back lines more than another, and those with the crafting know-wotz have to ensure they don’t find a shiv in their back from an enterprising rival looking to start their archery career. However, bows provide little in the way of close combat protection, and should the enemy break through to the Shootas’ lines, these grots can do little but clobber them with their bows.",

They do this not through learning and guile but by consuming quantities of toxic fungi that would kill humans thrice over and then jabbering incessantly about the resulting visions they experience. \n\nCave-Shamans fuel their magic with the Deffcap, a highly hallucinogenic mushroom that grows inside the shaman until it bursts out of their cranium. Cave-Shamans sporting such a fungus are capable of casting far more potent spells, for the mushroom appears to draw power from the Bad Moon itself.\n\nAny who seek an audience with a Cave-Shaman must tolerate the various squiggly beasts and other critters that nestle within their robes or writhe upon the grot’s gnarled flesh, such as the vicious Spore Squig, a common companion.",

The newly created Fanatic is then dosed with temporarily immobilising concoctions, so they may be carried into the fray without harming their peers, before being let loose, forcing enemies and allies alike to dive for cover.\n\nGripping heavy chains ending in huge iron balls that would normally take several grots to lift, Loonsmasha Fanatics revolve with escalating swiftness, transforming into cyclones of death. The life of a Fanatic is measured in minutes at best, but what glorious minutes they are. In the brief time before they inevitably bash in their own skulls, crash into a wall, sail off a cliff cackling insanely or careen back into their screaming mates, they are – in their own fungus-addled minds, at least – gods of annihilation.",

By the time a Rabble-Rowza emerges from the deepest depths, it is with a veritable parade of subterranean horrors in tow.

In a crude echo of jousters and their ostentatious finery, these braggadocious elites craft their ornamentation from fancy pieces of scrap metal scavenged from their foes. They are at their most powerful on the charge, for their unhinged bravado is at its peak before the enemy has had a chance to hit back, and their lances, shoddy as they are, can inflict surprising damage at full tilt. Should a Boingrot Bounder slay a foe and survive the battle, their inflated confidence renders them so insufferable that they are likely to come to an ignoble end, shanked in some dingy nook by their jealous peers and left for the squigs.",

Like all troggoths, these behemoths can live for hundreds of years thanks to their natural ability to regenerate, and the strongest and eldest of their kind will boast the most sprawling cave systems within their territory.\n\nThe Rockgut Troggoths’ fixation on eating stone, coupled with the adaptability of their race, has granted them two remarkable abilities. The first is a craggy exterior that is almost impervious to magical and mundane assault. Sleeping Rockguts have been mistaken for part of the landscape, until they wake up and start swinging their clubs. The second ability is a proficiency in manipulating rock that is nothing short of astounding, for in their lumpen hands the substance flows like water. There is no limit to the wonders of craft more enlightened races could achieve with this power. The Rockguts employ it for more direct purposes: scooping up chunks of earth to form massive boulders and hurling them at anything they take a disliking to.",

Despite this, most Loonbosses consider the damage that Squig Herds can inflict to be worthwhile enough to factor them into their schemes. Just as importantly, the havoc they wreak is always hilarious – provided it doesn’t affect the bossgrots themselves, of course.\n\nThe life of a Squig Herder once their horde goes on the march is measured in days – sometimes even minutes. Not only do their sharp Prodders antagonise their unpredictable charges, the grots are also a tempting snack for a hungry squig in the thick of battle. Such a sacrifice is often considered justifiable by the Herder’s mates, for the prospect of dinner can lure in other wild squigs. Due to the squigs’ incredible speed and bouncing prowess, as well as their strong fangs, even just one extra beast to herd is valued much more highly than another misguided minder to prod them forth.",

Loonbosses relish a fight, and weapons they wield are laden with so many spiteful enchantments that they can carve clean through steel plate. However, they never fight fair. Ducking and weaving around their enemies, they hurl mobs of cackling grots at them to wear them down before finishing them off with a slice to the throat or a blow between the shoulder blades. The best fights, after all, are the ones conducted from behind a green wall of underlings doing most of the dirty work.\n\nMany Loonbosses take squigs as mounts or pets and have their choice of prime specimens, among them the Giant Cave Squigs. Such bossgrots are often found at the head of a Squigalanche, and while it might be an exaggeration to say that they intentionally ‘lead’ their fellows anywhere, their force of personality is enough to draw squig-mounted greenskins to their side from miles around.",

They fight as swift skirmishers, peppering the enemy with arrows before charging in to pick off isolated survivors with jagged blades and their mounts’ venom-coated fangs. Any not slain outright are paralysed by debilitating spider bites and dragged back to the Spiderfang’s nests, there to meet a terrible fate at the jaws of the grots’ demigods.\n\nThe breed of spider ridden by these grots depends on where they make their lair, but all are dangerous. From the Blistermere Skullback to the Blue Cliffleaper, the Chamonite Ironweb to the sinister Dusk Creeper only seen in the deepest abysses of the Realm of Shadow, all possess wicked fangs and cruelty to match that of their greenskin allies. Many grots will raise their arachnid mount from infancy, as the bond between grot and spider goes a long way towards protecting the riders from being injected with venom and eaten themselves.",

Though usually cowardly creatures, grots will strike out madly should they think they have the advantage. Numbers are their greatest weapon, for they feel safer and stronger when surrounded by a press of their bickering kin. They also employ devious tricks to swing the odds in their favour, unafraid of fighting dirty and eschewing such hindrances as pride and honour. Weighted nets are a favourite, flung over enemies to leave them struggling and helpless while the grots jab them full of holes.",

Squig Hoppers are figures of awe to fellow grots, who cluster around them to hear their tales of derring-do. Though such stories are wildly exaggerated, should enough Squig Hoppers mass together, the anarchy and devastation they cause is awe-inspiring. They can reach speeds that are alarming to enemy and rider alike, usually resulting in cataclysmic collisions deep in enemy lines.\n\nThanks to their rubbery flesh and strong legs, Cave Squigs are natural jumpers, but to properly bound through the air and carry a grot to war, they must be made much more springy. To facilitate this, shamans will feed them all manner of brews designed to bloat the creatures up with gastric gases. At this point, the squigs can bounce high enough to cross even an advancing line of ogors. Of course, a squig bulging with excess gas is likely to be even more surly than normal, which doesn’t improve the prospects of any grot riding the creature.",

Their chitinous limbs can punch through the hull of a Steam Tank, their fangs drip with potent venom, and their webbing is so strong that even an ogor would struggle to tear free of it. What makes the Arachnaroks truly unsettling, however, is the malign intellect within their eight eyes.\n\nThough they once fed indiscriminately upon the Spiderfang grots, and will still do so should the fancy strike them, most Arachnaroks are amused enough by the greenskins’ worship and satiated by their offered sacrifices to serve as war-mounts. The youngest and most aggressive mega-spiders lead the charge, carrying howdahs filled with shrieking grot warriors. Arachnaroks care little for the sneaky plans and kunnin’ tricks of Spiderfang warleaders, instead prioritising their own desires. Given that to question these would be to go against the will of their gods, the grots must simply adapt on the fly. Usually, this involves raining hell down on the enemy wherever they may end up going with crude spears and envenomed arrows.",

This serves to further pitch the grots into a frenzy in a self-perpetuating cycle. They also serve as conduits through which reinforcements can arrive, as each shrine is set above a complex network of tunnels connecting them to surrounding lurklairs.

Ducking and weaving around their enemies, they hurl mobs of cackling grots at them to wear them down before finishing them off with a slice to the throat or a blow between the shoulder blades. The best fights, after all, are the ones conducted from behind a green wall of underlings doing most of the dirty work.\n\nTo become a Loonboss, a grot must climb the rungs of power by any means. Consequently, many become masters of unorthodox and opportunistic tactics, from feigning injury to pelting their enemies with exploding mushrooms that release flesh-eating spores. Loonbosses are infamously self possessed and eager to lavish themselves with grandiose titles such as Grand Under Emperor or Great Grotlord of the ’Umie-skinnas, but for all their preening, their cunning makes them as dangerous as any orruk boss.",

It is the job of the Sneaky Snufflers to collect Looncaps and return them to the shamans, who use them as ingredients for magical potions or to inspire sudden manic rages.\n\nSneaky Snufflers are aided by the weird cave-creatures known as Snufflesquigs, whose pronounced olfactory organs are highly attuned to different fungal strains. As battle rages, the grot handlers follow the beasts around, harvesting choice Looncaps with their trusty sickles. Sneaky Snufflers are not stingy in hurling bundles of Looncaps over to their mates, who upon eating the spongy morsels are overcome by a frothing battle-madness. The Snufflers watch what follows with wicked amusement, especially when it is discovered that certain instantly lethal mushrooms ‘accidentally’ made their way into the mix.",

They shun contact with other beings, seeking the comforting foulness of their lairs in which to sleep away the centuries. As they snooze, some strange quirk of biology sees them grow or shrink to fit their dankhold; some troggoths doze off within preposterously cramped caverns and awaken half their original size, or else they wake up from a nap after twenty years to find they have become several times larger than when they went to sleep.\n\nShould Dankhold Troggoths be drawn up to a battlefield by the Bad Moon, they are a force to be reckoned with. They are able to regenerate even the greatest wounds with a slow but steady inevitability, and their diet of fungi that grow around realmstone grants them natural resistance to sorcery. In turn, the beasts’ huge clubs and fiendishly strong hands can batter the life out of anything. Grots draw immense confidence from anything big, scary and on their side, and Dankhold Troggoths certainly fit the bill.",

Ducking and weaving around their enemies, they hurl mobs of cackling grots at them to wear them down before finishing them off with a slice to the throat or a blow between the shoulder blades. The best fights, after all, are the ones conducted from behind a green wall of underlings doing most of the dirty work.\n\nIt takes a particularly deranged loon to lead the charge whilst clinging on to a pair of giant squigs, but some Loonbosses – along with their most bonkers cronies – are only too eager to do so. Mangler Squigs are living wrecking balls, and though only the most tenacious grots could hope to survive the ride, those who succeed revel in the spectacular violence they inflict as they crash into the  melee, cackling in wicked glee as severed body parts, arcs of gore and screaming victims fly through the air all around them.",

When Mork’s Mighty Mushroom erupts onto the battlefield, it belches inescapable clouds of horrible motes that cause smaller Skullshrooms to violently burst forth from everything they touch – a process that has particularly messy results upon living things. Grots know to steer clear of even the smallest of these fungi, as simply brushing a finger against one can lead to a painful death.\n\nIn order to cultivate the requisite spores between their toes, Gloomspite mages will carefully harvest Skullshrooms and mix them into potions and tonics. They will then dose themselves with such draughts once a day, remaining in the darkest depths of their lurklairs. After a few weeks of hard sweating, avoiding bodies of water and tramping around in the mud, a good reserve of fungal crust will build up in the divots of their feet, thus beginning the cycle anew.",

These arcane creatures have a symbiotic relationship with grotkind, for the murky lairs favoured by the greenskins are perfectly moist, sprawling and dark, and dank magic coalesces naturally within them. In the bowels of the realms, Scuttletides will form and soak up ambient magic from subterranean ley lines and nexus points, leaving them swollen with magic force. The sorcerous energies of the Scuttletide are further bolstered by nearby Arachnaroks, causing wave after wave of the crawling critters to be drawn forth to overrun the foe.",

Even in their death throes, Manglers enter a pea-brained frenzy, bouncing around in a last explosion of horrific brutality before finally rolling to a stop amidst the broken remains of their slayers. The chains that hold them together are also weapons in their own right, shredding through warriors unlucky enough to get tangled up in them.",

Many are impossibly ancient, sustained by their pronounced regenerative abilities. It is rare indeed for a Troggboss to rouse itself from slumber and trudge up to the surface. This is fortunate, for to witness one on the rampage is a fearsome sight indeed. Nothing seems to trouble them as they lumber forwards, while each thunderous swing of their clubs can stave in the skull of a Draconith or shatter a shieldwall. In a Troggboss’s wake skitter Spiteshrooms and Stalagsquigs, Git-grabbers and Nightskulkers – all manner of denizens from the Deep and Dark come to savage their loathsome lord’s enemies.\n\nThe most fearsome aspect of a Troggboss is the effect it has on its fellows. An aura of primal authority penetrates the layers of stupidity that cloud the troggoths’ minds and sees them lumber along in their boss’s wake. A meaningful grunt from a Troggboss can compel its mates to act with something dangerously close to focus, redoubling their destructive efforts at a choice moment.",

Their zealous adulation of all things eight-legged, coupled with the arachnoid energies flowing through them and visions induced by bites from the creepy crawlies that infest their web cloaks, ensure that they are often utterly demented. Still, the mutative blessings granted unto these shamans – usually in the form of extra eyes or limbs – mark them as their god’s favoured. Should a Webspinner command his ladz to let spiders lay eggs in their ears or attempt to weave new cloaks from Arachnarok silk, it will be done with only a modicum of grumbling.\n\nWebspinner Shamans are driven by their fervent desire to please the Spider God. They believe that their deity wishes the Everdank to cover the lands, so that all of its arachnid children can spill forth and hunt forever amidst the twilight shadows. This belief, coupled with the constant need to appease the hungry Arachnaroks that dwell in their nests, makes Webspinner Shamans warlike leaders. Their spellcraft also reflects their faith; with ululating incantations, they can conjure sheets of webbing and summon tides of sorcerous spiders to swarm over foes.",
