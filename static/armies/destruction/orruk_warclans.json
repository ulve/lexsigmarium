      "lore": "In the Realm of Beasts, sometimes a volley of crossbow bolts the length of a man’s arm is not quite enough. So it was that the vicious-looking devices known as Beast-skewer Killbows were invented. These are not crossbows so much as orruk-portable ballistas capable of penetrating a Stonehorn’s hide and cracking apart the rocky skeleton beneath. Even the strongest man would struggle to cock such a bow, let alone carry it to battle, but for the ‘big shots’ that use them, these Killbows are constant companions.\n\nWhenever there is a nice juicy target to be impaled, whether it be a roving monster or enemy leader, the Beast-skewer boys will set up their weapons on a solid surface, line up a shot and let fly. A snivelling grot servant is always kept close at hand to carry a quiver full of spears on the orruk big shot’s behalf and help reload the Killbow all the faster after each bolt is loosed. Should the orruk miss their mark, their assistant can look forward to a resounding thump around the noggin for ‘mukkin’ it up again’.",

Inevitably, the lesser of the pair is left shattered in the dust and the orruk rider is launched into the air. The heavily concussed warrior has scant moments to grab hold of a fistful of matted fur in order to bring themselves down atop the Maw-grunta’s back; if they don’t, they crash to the ground and are left wide open to a lethal goring from the beast.\n\nNeedless to say, this manoeuvre does not have a particularly high success rate. Those one in a hundred orruks who survive this deranged practice, however, can smugly boast of having dominated one of the most formidable beasts in Ghur. These Maw-grunta riders gather into charging mobs, delighting in the unstoppable force of their porcine mounts as they smash through the enemy like an avalanche of leathery flesh and stinking bristles. When they are not clinging on for dear life, these burly champions wield a pair of choppas with reckless abandon, swiping out at the blurred shapes of the enemy as their Maw-grunta goes barrelling past.",

This is true for the most part – but even the rampaging throng of an Ironjawz army needs some direction, even if it’s just whether to go left or right.\n\nArdboy Big Bosses provide this by browbeating the mobs under their command into a semblance of order for as long as it takes them to reach the enemy line and start killing. Of course, at that point, the Big Boss joins in the fun, swept up by the sheer thrill of violence. Usually armed with a boss-hacka for enthusiastic pointing and stabbing, as well as a jagged choppa for close-quarters work, Big Bosses remind their boyz why they are in charge with every act of bone‑shattering brutality.",

Though he currently wages a protracted war in the Realm of Life, Kragnos can still be drawn to battle by the most ferocious fighting, his arrival announced by the smashing of enemy lines and the crushing of foes under his thunderous hooves.\n\nAlready a natural disaster made manifest, Kragnos’s rampages are further augmented by his legendary armaments. The shield Tuskbreaker is said to have been cast aside by Gorkamorka himself, deity of the orruks and other brutish beings. The spells of enemy mages break instantly upon its surface, supposedly due to the residual divine essence that suffuses it. The Dread Mace, Kragnos’s massive studded club, is powerful enough to shatter walls of solid rock. Legends say that Kragnos retrieved the weapon’s head from an ancient geomantic nexus, and that it is infused with Ghur’s own destructive animus.",

No one can doubt a Brute’s talent for thuggery, but sometimes even they bite off more than they can chew.\n\nBrutes that have suffered some form of stinging defeat often overcompensate by becoming even more unbearably arrogant, discarding their armour and taking up huge, two-handed weapons. With these, they swiftly silence any orruk foolish enough to bring up their past humiliation. These Brute Ragerz take any opportunity to show how ’ard they truly are, hurling themselves into the deadliest battles without a care. This desperation to prove their might makes the Ragerz a terrifying foe to face on the battlefield, and their lack of armour allows them to move with a speed that can catch opponents used to fighting lumbering armoured juggernauts completely off guard.",

These apparently wise orruks possess no greater insight; they resort to hammering bone-and-iron masks deep into the skulls of the afflicted Brutes in an attempt to let out the wonkiness. Ironically enough, the sheer agony and white-hot fury caused by this process actually does fix the victim’s odd behaviour – albeit by transforming them into a maniacal killer. Known as Weirdbrute Wrekkaz, these orruks see the world around them as an inferno of green fire, the clumped masses of enemy troops shining with particular intensity. Wielding oversized flails known as chain-smashas, they throw themselves at these luminous concentrations, whirling their weapons to shatter limbs and smash skulls into blood‑spattered fragments.",

Their superior kunnin’ in battle, however, is what they are renowned for. They fight in the most underhanded way, whether throwing mud or blinding powder into their opponents’ eyes, laying traps, tripping the legs or kicking the groin. Their jagged blades are designed to hook and pull away shields to find the vulnerable flesh behind.\n\nThe Great Gnashtoofs ridden by some Killabosses are quick-witted and surprisingly agile for their size. Though habitual scavengers, they are always happy to seize smaller creatures – a category that includes most humanoids – and rip them to pieces so they can get on with the scavenging bit later. When on the hunt, Great Gnashtoofs can ‘throw’ their barks to make it sound like they are approaching from elsewhere. Then, when the prey’s back is turned, they will pounce, revealing the true danger behind the phantom threat.",

Even as the creature thrashes and gores many orruks, others rush forward to loop heavy chains around its flanks and drop a jawbone harness into position. The biggest and toughest warrior present claims the best position on the Maw-grunta’s back, while others chain themselves atop iron platforms on each side of the harness.\n\nThrough such brutal means is a Maw-grunta joined with a ‘hakkin’ krew’, giving rise to one of the most fearsome engines of war in the Ironjawz arsenal. Any Megaboss understands the value of having one or two of these monstrosities in their army, using them to smash down a fortress wall or topple a shield line. Once the Ardboy on top has yanked the Maw-grunta’s chains and aimed their mount at the nearest enemy warriors, little can be done to adjust its headlong rampage, and so they concentrate instead on hacking and slashing away with a pair of choppas. Their krew, meanwhile, need to do little more than swipe with their kill-choppas as the charge hits home.",

Led by a sly Beastnob, they prowl through the wilderness laying traps and creating distractions so that they might catch a beast unawares and batter it into submission. As befits their devious kind, these orruks employ every underhanded method conceivable to render their quarry helpless, even employing wild creatures of their own, such as the aggressive simians known as Gnarlwood Howlaz.\n\nWhile they specialise in hunting beasts, Monsta-killaz take great delight in ambushing rivals that interfere with their business. Many of the skills they have mastered out in the wilds can be turned against two-legged foes. Watching a Howla pull a screaming human’s arms out of their sockets is always a good laugh, as is concealing the egg clutch of a Spinecrawler amidst the scroll-cases of some pointy-eared aelven wizard and guffawing loudly as the outraged monstrosity enacts its gory revenge.",

Designed to strike terror into the hearts of their foes, it takes the appearance a giant, fanged visage upon a pole – often a highly stylised representation of Kragnos, the Earthquake God.\n\nImpaled upon the ‘teeth’ of the yawning maw is the tongue of a toad wyvern, mire-drake or some other backwater denizen. It is traditionally the Murknob himself who makes the kill and cuts the tongue from his prize; that is what he tells everyone, at any rate. The tongue is the source of the eye-wateringly ripe stink that emanates from the Belcha-banna whenever it is hoisted into the wind. This horrific smell is magnified tenfold before battle by the spells of the warclan’s shamans, who also bind the dead creature’s outraged spirit to the mouth of the banner so that it issues bellowing roars and thunderous burps. So supernaturally powerful are these sounds that they can even dissipate magic that threatens the Murknob and his boyz.",

This difference in station, of course, is significant only among the Ironjawz orruks themselves; to the other races, Ardboyz are nothing less than terrifying, heavily armoured killing machines. The scores of defeated armies left hacked apart on the battlefield attest to their ferocity, and all are hardened veterans toughened by a diet of non-stop violence.\n\nArdboyz maintain an air of discipline until the moment they make contact with the foe, at which point they start bellowing madly, swinging their choppas with wild abandon and kicking and punching with primal gusto. Some Ardboyz wield heavy spears called stikkas. These were first employed during the Era of the Beast to make it easier to stab holes in rampaging monsters from afar and to provide a bluntly effective response to foes likewise equipped with polearms. Whatever weapon they wield, Ardboyz usually carry a hefty slab of spiked iron that functions as both shield and skull-crushing close-combat weapon.",

Yet when battle is joined and the first kills are claimed by the Boltboyz, such detractors fall strangely silent. The Boltboyz themselves simply shrug and walk at an unhurried pace towards the survivors, reloading as they go.\n\nWhen on the hunt, Man-skewer Boltboyz fire to injure rather than to kill, relishing the sight of a crippled enemy limping away before the next volley puts them down for good. In battle, they go right for the headshot. Many soldiers have dismissed an orruk shoota-line in the belief that they are terrible shots, only to find man-skewer bolts have a very long reach and pack enough punch to send an armoured enemy flying backwards. It is common practice amongst the Boltboyz to coat their bolts in the most horrendous toxins, and the spikes on each bolt are made deliberately brittle so they snap off to leave shards in the wound. With a sadistic cackle and a ‘clunk-click’ of reloader arms, the orruks are soon ready to shoot again.",

Their eyes glow, ectoplasm spilling from their mouth as they shudder in the grip of a grand frenzy. Then, with a convulsive roar, they belch forth killing green magic in a vomitous tide of pure Waaagh! energy.\n\nMuch like the orruks themselves, Waaagh! magic is violent, unpredictable and dangerous to everything in its vicinity. Its essence sits outside the typical ‘laws’ of magic, neither drawn from a particular realmsphere nor corrupted by dark sorcery. The scholars of other races have long had difficulty defining where the primal energy of an orruk horde ends and proper Waaagh! magic begins. In truth, these concepts are one and the same. More than one Tzeentchian sorcerer or Lumineth mystic has entered into a magical duel with a mad-eyed Weirdnob, only to find themselves overwhelmed by a wild power that simply cannot be undone.",

Their weapons are similarly direct. Weighty choppas and long-hafted hackas are abundant, each a crude but devastatingly effective tool of destruction. Some Brutes instead wield the gigantic, jag-spiked blades known as gore-choppas, enormous weapons capable of decapitating an ogor in a ragged explosion of blood and flesh.",

Each of these creatures weighs a ton or more, and they become even heavier when the orruks armour them in their signature slabs of iron plate. When a grunta gets the scent of blood in its snout, it will go into a ravenous frenzy – and much the same can be said about its rider. There is a lot in common between the two, including a thuggish temperament, a hunger for meat and even jutting tusks perfect for mauling the foe.\n\nThe Gore-gruntas, as the riders of these beasts call themselves, break battlelines by simply crashing into them at full speed. Enemies that somehow survive the horrendous impact are usually hacked down or decapitated by the bellowing orruk riders as they lay about themselves with their weighty choppas and hackas. Some Megabosses have come up with ‘taktikz’ for these assaults, such as the flank-crushing ‘Hoof Puncher’ or the twofold assault known as the ‘Tusks of Gork’. Regardless of their exact approach, all of these methods involve assembling Gore‑gruntas into a big stampede and sending them straight at the enemy’s lines.",

They are conduits for roiling Waaagh! energy who possess the ability to harness the crude magics of their race without immediately detonating in a burst of green light. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the spells wrought by a Swampcalla Shaman all possess an ugly, slimy edge. With a wave of their staff and a rattling of knucklebones, a Swampcalla can transform the ground before them into a sucking peat bog or summon foul, choking mists.\n\nAs well as more traditional spellflinging, it is the Swampcalla Shamans who create the toxins and bog-brews so readily employed by the Kruleboyz and feared by their enemies. Like their magic, there seems to be little formal training in how to create such broths; most Swampcallas simply toss whatever ingredients feel right into a dented cauldron, bid their Pot-grot minions stir it all up while grunting appropriate-sounding ritual phrases, then test it out on the nearest unlucky captive. Their concoctions usually have a constitution-enhancing effect on any orruks who gulp them down, though every now and again, something outright lethal finds its way into the mix…",

This act has an almost religious significance to the orruks, who refer to it by such terms as ‘givin’ it some bite’ and ‘puttin’ on da grin’. Yet the main purpose of these shields, as well as to protect the orruks, is to terrify the foe; the blood and slime of bloated swamp creatures is daubed across their faces, reacting with the shrouding fog summoned by the Swampcallas to glow with a weird bioluminescence. The Gutrippaz add to this unsettling image by banging their weapons together loudly, howling like rabid beasts or bawling crude raiding songs. Gutrippaz, by nature, prefer it when a fight begins in their favour, but their blood runs as hot as any orruk’s, and when a scrap is properly underway, the biggest difficulty for a Killaboss looking to take prisoners can be getting the Gutrippaz to stop.",

Maw-krushas take on the Carnosaurs of the deep jungle and the Magmadroths of the volcanoes without a second thought, and they often sport scales dented by the jaws of some monstrous predator as a result. It is said that their ability to fly has more to do with the fact that gravity is scared to mess with them than with any aerodynamic prowess; those who see this beast sailing through the air towards them like a thrown brick are crushed before they can investigate further. Though a Maw-krusha will turn on its rider if given half a chance, the combination of hulking orruk and grumpy scalebeast can take down even a drake at close quarters, so it is usually judged well worth the risk.",

Orruks from miles around are drawn to the booming rhythm by instinctive compulsion, swelling the horde’s ranks further as the furious heartbeat of Gorkamorka echoes across the land.",

Never stopping for a moment longer than it takes to rip a foe’s guts out with a swipe of their trusty pig‑hacka, a Tuskboss rampages across the realms in an endless stampede, trampling all before them into gory paste.\n\nMaw-gruntas are omnivorous in the extreme, lowering their massive, tusked maws and gobbling up anything in their path. Metal, stone, wood and meat: all are digested in the beast’s three stomachs, which are filled with extremely potent acids. Segmented plates of iron are strapped to the Maw-grunta’s flanks, turning one of nature’s most ferocious killing machines into a living tank almost impervious to musketry and spears. The more speed the Maw‑grunta builds up, the more devastating the impact, and a skilled Tuskboss knows how to bring their charge home with bone‑shattering results.",

They can regenerate damage at an alarming rate, wounds sealing over and broken bones reknitting in a matter of minutes. So tall and strong are these beasts that they can wade through deep quagmires without slowing, making them ideal mounts for the marsh-traversing Breaka-bosses, who do not so much as get their feet wet before the beasts emerge dripping on the other side. These troggoths also endure the perils of battle well due to their disconnect with physical pain. When a Mirebrute is wounded, it will lash out in a violent frenzy at whatever is directly in front of it. This is especially true if the beast is blinkered; it literally sees only the foes standing before it. The Breaka-bosses find the ability to jab their steeds and make the enemy pay the price endlessly entertaining – and that price is typically being hammered flat by the massive clubs the beast is armed with.",

      "lore": "Most infamous of all Swampcalla Shamans is Gobsprakk. He is the greatest prophet of orruk-kind, the Mouth of Mork, and it is clear the favour of the kunnin’ god is upon him. Green energy crackles around Gobsprakk when his ire is raised, and even the biggest orruks have learnt to fear the narrowing of the shaman’s eyes, for someone’s sudden demise follows soon after. Those who cross him have a strange habit of choking to death as their lungs fill with swamp water, even if they are standing upon an arid plain. Should an enemy survive his perfidious spells, they are snatched up in the talons of his beloved Corpse-rippa Vulcha, Killabeak.\n\nThough his shamanic power is immense, by far the most impressive weapon Gobsprakk possesses is his intelligence. His reputation as the voice of his god – and that of Kragnos, to boot – has spread across the realms, and he wields such influence well, commanding orruks of every kind to flock to his banner. He is often seen at the head of great armies, directing them by sharing what Mork has allegedly whispered in his ear that day. Whether the green-skinned god actually speaks to Gobsprakk or whether this is an elaborate ruse has never been proven.",

Their superior kunnin’ in battle, however, is what they are renowned for. They fight in the most underhanded way, whether throwing mud or blinding powder into their opponents’ eyes, laying traps, tripping the legs or kicking the groin. Their jagged blades are designed to hook and pull away shields to find the vulnerable flesh behind.\n\nThe most infamous Killabosses are accompanied to war by a loose entourage of eager hangers-on. Though the advice of a shaman or the extra muscle of a nob bodyguard are always vital, many Killabosses will keep an attendant Stab‑grot, often as a spiteful and obnoxious mascot to bolster their image. That is not to say that these grots are useless in combat; many are chosen for their unusual prowess at hamstringing or their extra-sneaky disposition. More often than not, however, they are simply there to act as a handy meat-shield should the battle go awry.",

Yet it is not Skumdrekk’s impressive menagerie that has clinched his fame so much as his skill as a bet-master. With a talent for the finer points of wagering, bartering and – naturally – cheating, Skumdrekk has grown impossibly rich. Captives by the hundred are brought to the Murkvast Menagerie, and the roots of the mangrove trees are pulled aside to let specific beasts roam free. The details of who gets killed by what are the subject of an endless series of bets, with Skumdrekk and his Kountin’ Krew – a cadre of devious hobgrots backed up by troggoth muscle – presiding over the whole affair.\n\nSkumdrekk rides the elder beast Sloppklaw, a Sludgeraker he broke to his will as a yoof and his faithful steed to this day. Though extremely near-sighted and a bit senile, Sloppklaw is still the fiercest of his kind yet encountered, and he has a talent for sudden explosions of violence – any victim caught by Skumdrekk’s snatcha-stikk and dragged near the beast’s muzzle will be swiftly eviscerated.",

Only when the enemy is in ‘killin’ range’ do they form up once more, hurling their hard-won explosive bangstikks into the foe – half of which exude volatile gas that is explosively ignited by the incendiary contents of the others – before charging in to finish the job with their nastylooking, razor-sharp blades.",

They tend towards easy kills and will gladly gobble up the young of other species instead of taking on fully grown prey. A Sloggoth’s long, flexible arms are perfect for reaching into hideaways to snatch those within, much to the horror of enemies who seek refuge from them. When their quarry is caught, they will burst into sudden action, jaws darting forward to clamp down on the head of their victim. To add to their list of awful qualities, like other breeds of troggoth, their uncanny constitution allows them to regenerate wounds at an alarming rate.\n\nCaptive Sloggoths will have a howdah mounted on their back, in which grots will ride to war. No orruk worth his teef would be seen dead on such a cowardly beast, but the grots understand that beneath this veneer is a beast capable of great violence when goaded to action. They hurl weighted nets from its back and thrust out man-snatcher polearms to disarm or incapacitate those that would otherwise escape their Sloggoth’s grasping claws.",

Others say that he was swallowed by a great stone idol of Gork, chewed up and spat out with god-given power.\n\nAnvilsmasha only makes an appearance when a Waaagh! swells to truly earth-shaking proportions. Striking his smith’s tools together until they glow bright with destructive energy, he sends this magic out across the orruks gathered nearby, whose weapons start to thrum with power. A choppa or basha so blessed by Anvilsmasha can lay low a Chaos Knight or knock a Draconith senseless, for when it hits home, it unleashes a thunderous blast of force.\n\nWaddling beside Zoggrok comes his constant companion, a rockbrow squig named Klonk. Born with a splitting headache that causes it constant pain, its suffering can only be temporarily relieved by a repeated bludgeoning of the head – making it the perfect tool on which Anvilsmasha can practise his craft.",

Their superior kunnin’ in battle, however, is what they are renowned for. They fight in the most underhanded way, whether throwing mud or blinding powder into their opponents’ eyes, laying traps, tripping the legs or kicking the groin. Their jagged blades are designed to hook and pull away shields to find the vulnerable flesh behind.\n\nOnly a true ruler amongst Kruleboyz can bend one of the titanic raptors known as a Corpse-rippa Vulcha to their will. These massive, winged monstrosities have beaks that can bite through rock and talons that can shred steel, but like their riders, they also exhibit a predilection for cunning and cruelty. Each Vulcha picks a large and twisted tree as its larder. On its sharp, leafless branches, the Vulcha will impale its still-living kills, letting them die slow deaths and hang there to get nice and juicy with rot before gobbling them down.",

With long arms strong enough to drag large prey underwater, drooling jaws and a tail like a multi-corded scourge, Sludgerakers are formidable indeed. These stealthy ambush predators know when to submerge beneath the swamp-scum as they stalk their prey and how to level a single strike before withdrawing in the knowledge that the infected wound will bring their victim down effortlessly. Sludgerakers exude a greasy secretion to make it hard for other creatures to grapple them. The more slimy swamp-beasts they consume, the more pungent this rancid musk becomes. Kruleboyz will wipe their blades on a Sludgeraker’s belly before battle, for the rotting mixture there is so noxious it will quickly fester with the merest scratch.",
